      "captions": "there is President Trump and French president Emanuel macron well thank you very much everyone great honor to be here with my friend I&amp;#39;m delighted to welcome president mcon back to the White House we&amp;#39;ve been together quite often but not that often in the white house we honored the president first lady of France uh not so long ago it was a beautiful evening and uh we will not soon forget it it was a beautiful day and evening and many fond memories I also want to thank Emanuel for hosting me and Paris last December after a historic election win to witness the reopening of the spectacular notredam Cathedral where you did an outstanding job in bringing it back together that was a sad day watching that burn and five years later you had it up and it was uh they say more beautiful than it was before so I think that&amp;#39;s a great achievement that was not easy France is America&amp;#39;s oldest Ally our cherish partnership has been a force for Freedom prosperity and peace from the very beginning we&amp;#39;re now working on some very interesting developments one in particular as you know the war between Russia and Ukraine in the American Revolution French support helped us to seize our destiny as an independent nation in the first and second world wars our citizens shed blood together on the battlefields of Europe and I&amp;#39;ll never forget joining president mcon six years ago in the 75th anniversary of D-Day that was someday the purpose of our meeting today is to end another battle a really horrible one a war something that we haven&amp;#39;t seen since the second world war that is ravaging European soil the deadliest and most destructive conflict that one can imagine I&amp;#39;ve seen the pictures I&amp;#39;ve seen the satellite photos and and lots of other photos and it&amp;#39;s a horrible thing that&amp;#39;s happening thousands of people are dying a week this very day is the third aniversary of the invasion of Ukraine which would never have happened if I was president that was not going to happen the horrors of this gruesome and bloody war can scarcely be overestimated hundreds of thousands of people Russians and ukrainians in particular have needlessly died an entire generation of ukrainians and Russian men has been decimated 1,000 year old cities have been turned into Rubble those beautiful spires that you used to see there they were most beautiful in the world they say are lying in heaps of rubble blasted to Smither Rines and it&amp;#39;s time to end this bloodletting and restore peace and I think we&amp;#39;re going to do it we&amp;#39;ve had some great conversations including with Russia since my return to the White House we&amp;#39;ve made more progress toward that goal in one month than occurred in the past three years and I&amp;#39;ve spoken with both President Putin and president zalinski and again a lot of a lot of good things toward peace are happening moving it I think pretty quickly last week Secretary of State Marco Rubio National Security adviser Michael walson special Envoy Steve witkoff conducted successful talks in Saudi Arabia with the delegation from Russia and I&amp;#39;d like to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and uh the king and Muhammad uh great people they&amp;#39;re really working hard to get this done our focus is on achieving a ceasefire as as soon as possible and ultimately a permanent peace my meeting with president mccrone today was another important step forward in that on that sphere because uh he&amp;#39;s been very much involved right from the beginning in trying to get it over with then we&amp;#39;re going to get it done I believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues Chief among them is uh this is the right time it may be the only time you know that&amp;#39;s a very interesting and and horrible situation and that could evolve into a third world war we&amp;#39;re not going to let that happen should have never started but it did and uh what a mess what a horrible bloody mess I&amp;#39;m also pleased that President mcon agrees that the cost and burden of securing the peace must be borne by the nations of Europe Not Alone by the United States and Europe must take that Central role in assuring long-term security of Ukraine which they want to do and that&amp;#39;s not a very big step the big step is what&amp;#39;s going to happen over the next few weeks the United States has put up far more aid for Ukraine than any other Nation hundreds of billions of dollars we&amp;#39;ve spent more than 300 billion and Europe has spent about a 100 100 billion that&amp;#39;s a big difference and at some point we should equalize but hopefully won&amp;#39;t have to worry about that we have other things happening that may be take that out of the realm of necessity and while we&amp;#39;ve given vast amounts of military aid and money in form of Grants much of Europe&amp;#39;s contribution has been economic relief structured as loans for which they&amp;#39;ll be repaid like the Europeans I believe that taxpayers and the United States also deserve to recoup the Colossal amounts of money that we&amp;#39;ve sent the previous administration never even thought of that they didn&amp;#39;t think of a lot of things like why did they let it start in the first place that is why we must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and RAR us and various other things as security and I think that that&amp;#39;s happening I think we&amp;#39;ve made a lot of progress I had a report just given to me before walking in that uh We&amp;#39;ve made Emanuel a great deal of progress toward getting that I&amp;#39;ve been elected by the American people to restore common sense to Washington and indeed to the world and I believe strongly that it&amp;#39;s in the best interest of the United States the best interest in Europe the best interest of Ukraine and indeed the best interest of Russia to Stop The Killing now and bring the world to peace my Administration is making a decisive break with the foreign policy failures of the past administration and frankly the past I ran against a very foolish foreign policy The Establishment and their recklessness has led to the death of many many people under our Administration we&amp;#39;re forging A New Path that promotes peace around the world and when I left office for the first Administration first term we had no Wars we had no problems we didn&amp;#39;t have October 7th with Israel we didn&amp;#39;t have Russia and Ukraine going at it we didn&amp;#39;t have the problems in other parts of the Middle East we didn&amp;#39;t have inflation it was a whole different world and you know what else we didn&amp;#39;t have millions of people pouring through our borders many of them criminals released from other nations and put right into our land murderers and drug dealers gangs we didn&amp;#39;t have any of that it&amp;#39;s a different time but now we have it and we&amp;#39;re fixing it we&amp;#39;ll fix it all up we&amp;#39;ll get it done as quickly as possible and we&amp;#39;ve made a great deal of progress people are saying it was the best month for a president in our country&amp;#39;s history I hope that&amp;#39;s right but I feel it&amp;#39;s right we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve done a lot of things in a very short period of time four weeks as I&amp;#39;ve said before it&amp;#39;s my hope that my greatest Legacy however will be as a peacemaker and a unifier I want to bring peace not War I thank president mcon for joining us today in this urgent work we&amp;#39;re doing we have some wonderful people up front right here that have worked so hard Steve witkoff thank you very much and Michael walz thank you Scott thank you very much and JD thank you they&amp;#39;ve really done a they&amp;#39;ve really done a job they worked very hard it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s a real passion to get this war ended and I&amp;#39;d like to uh now invite Emanuel to say a few words and then we&amp;#39;ll take questions and again Emanuel it&amp;#39;s a great honor to have you with us at the White House thank you very much please thank you thank you Mr President thank you dear Donald ministers ladies and gentlemen saying a few words in French thank you very much Mr President dear Donald for your hospitality and for this visit as you mentioned we have had the opportunity to meet over the past few years since your first term we&amp;#39;ve been able to discuss matters in Paris and also here at the White House and it has always been a great joy to do that and I would like to commend you and thank you Mr President for extending this friendship to France and taking part in the ceremony at notredam that you mentioned before it was a great honor for the French people to reopen the cathedral to the rest of the world and your presence was a testament to that friendship as the president said this friendship dates back to the Revolutionary War since the beginning of the United States and whenever we&amp;#39;ve needed to we&amp;#39;ve been able to come together and be on the right side we&amp;#39;ve been able to be United to defend peace and sovereignty namely in the two world wars that marked the 20th century from Lafayette to persing and to the many Americans who landed on Omaha Beach and we spoke earlier before and you mentioned that one of those uh gentlemen was able to visit you here one of the veterans this is part of History which puts us in the world that we are in today and as the president just said there are many challenges in this world and over the past few days we have one main objective which is the geopolitical situation Mr President I really wish to thank you for making changes to your schedule to meet with us so quickly I think we&amp;#39;ve made very substantive steps forward during our discussions and this is a major step in what we&amp;#39;re experiencing today we had a video conference with all of the G7 leaders which was an opportunity for us to discuss this matter 3 days after the uh Russian war in Ukraine and to express our support for president salinski to the Ukrainian people but also to speak and share about our desire for a lasting peace this is what we have spoken about very forcibly over the past few weeks we thought that this war was only going to last a few weeks when it broke out in 2022 we admire greatly the courage of the Ukrainian people and Mr President I wish to thank you for this you mentioned that there are responsibilities on Europe&amp;#39;s side and indeed we have invested 128 billion in Aid to Ukraine and the ukrainians Ukraine has been able to hold the front of our collective security it&amp;#39;s fought over these past few years for its independence and for its sovereignty but also for our collective security because I think that no one in this room wants to live in a world where it&amp;#39;s the law of the strongest and international borders can be violated from one day to the next by anyone over the past few hours and as you mentioned this uh Mr President we&amp;#39;ve been able to see a few things take shape first of all allow me to commend you on your decision to uh work with president sininsky and to conclude this agreement that&amp;#39;s so important for the US and train on rare Earths critical minerals but also having substantive conf conversations with president sininsky during this key phase of achieving this deal which is a major commitment to Ukraine&amp;#39;s sovereignty and I think that&amp;#39;s very commendable we also have a shared desire to build peace we will have this responsibility this is 10 years after the war started in Crimea and then we saw the events in Donas in the donbas region and along the northern part of the country we want to save lives we want to bring prisoners back and bring back families and children because there&amp;#39;s also humanitarian tragedy affecting the Ukrainian people we had lengthy discussions with the president and we spoke about our desire to bring an end to conflicts have a truce that is measurable verifiable and that enables negotiation of a lasting peace where we will discuss not only Ukraine&amp;#39;s reconstruction its territories but also the security guarantees meaning maintaining peace over the long term as I said to the president we&amp;#39;ve experienced Peace Accords that were only ceasefires without ensuring security guarantees Minsk one and two and we want to make sure this doesn&amp;#39;t happen again and I know that the president has expressed the desire to be a player for peace in the region I&amp;#39;ve spoken with some 30 European leaders and allies in recent days we want to bring together these allies allies rather and share the same vision this peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine it must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees this peace must must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders regarding the issues it affects that affects it rather but it is also a country in which we need to shoulder our responsibility so that we ensure security and stability for Ukraine and for the entire region and for us Europeans this is an existential issue we also spoke about these issues at like with the president we&amp;#39;ve worked with president zelinske and gotten to some of the details of the various phases of the negotiation and we&amp;#39;ve also been able to speak about some of this work with our British Partners to talk about deployments of Peace forces on Ukrainian soil which are part of these security guarantees other countries are ready to join in this effort solidarity and support from the US will be crucial to this and I thank you Mr President for beginning to work with us on this issue and the agreement that you are preparing to sign with you Ukraine and with all the discussions we&amp;#39;ve had are very solid guarantees that we are understood and that we have the same wish peace as soon as possible lasting Solid Peace for everyone and the renewal of an intern National situation where we are all able to shoulder our responsibilities Europeans shouldering their responsibilities alongside their American Allies who will shoulder their own responsibilities I also wanted to be very clear Mr President about Europe&amp;#39;s commitment we have committed to building a lasting peace as Europeans we have committed to being Stak holders in in these security guarantees and we are also well aware that Europeans need to do more for security in Europe for defense in Europe and to more fairly share the security bden burden that your country&amp;#39;s been carrying for so many years Mr President you know how much friendship I show towards you and I have towards you since your first term Europe is very cleare eyed about this we know what we need to do as Europeans given the threats surrounding us and the responsibilities that we must shoulder we spoke about the versai agenda which allowed the Europeans to take a historic step and increase their Investments Europeans are ready to do even more and to go even farther and several leaders said that to me before I came here to meet you Mr President dear Donald you spoke about this peace through strength we fully share that because we must recognize the sacrifices made by the Ukrainian people and what we owe to them the president and I also spoke about economic matters and our desire to see more prosperity in the United States and in Europe we had discussions which will be carried on by our teams our ministers and secretaries to flesh out some of those ideas but the idea is to have Fair competition and no bias within competition between our Industries now the American and European economies are extremely intertwined some 1.5 billion in trade a trillion rather in goods and services and I know you&amp;#39;ve spoken about wanting to look at the B of payments we also have a trade def deficit and I know that we need to look not only at Goods but also digital items and goods which you export and we want to make a sere commitment towards Fair competition where we have smooth trade and more Investments you already invest a great deal in France and France is the fifth most the fifth largest investor in the United States and I would like to recognize here all of the American investors who announced Investments some $20 billion dollar that were announced at the AI Summit this is our wish we want to have more Prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic we have a shared agenda in that regard we also spoke about the Middle East among other subjects and here again we have the same desire we don&amp;#39;t want to see Iran obtain nuclear weapons we don&amp;#39;t want or rather we want an approach with Partners in the region that we can trust given Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear activities we want to limit its ballistic capabilities and avoid any type of regional destabilization with respect to Syria and Iraq we also share the same desire we don&amp;#39;t want to see Islamic terrorist groups resume any of their activities because for some time our armies have very bravely been engaged in the Gulf as you have led and contributions have been significant and helped stability in the region and I say this with great sincerity uh France was affected by a terrorist attack in 2015 which was linked to the terrorist activity in Syria and and we are in that region at your side to work for more security ladies and gentlemen we had extremely productive discussions this morning during the conference and we spoke with our ministers and counselors and advisors and I wish to say after speaking with President Trump I am fully believe that there is a path forward we share the same beliefs we know what work needs to be done and the weeks to come we will work on that our teams will come together in various formats to make sure that we have this solid lasting peace with great strength Mr President thank you so much for welcoming me here today thank you so much for these productive discussions and for your commitment thank you dear Donald thank you okay thank you very much Brian would you like to ask a question go ahead welcome I just want to touch upon real quickly the Harvard poll that came out that had thank you very much the Harvard poll that came out had you up nine plus points and all of your agenda that you ran on you&amp;#39;re accomplishing that you got the support of the American people including stopping the war in Ukraine if you can comment on the latest Harvard poll I appreciate that well I was honored by it it was a big poll and it&amp;#39;s a usually a poll that leans on the other side of things the other side of the world so to speak but the har poll is a respected poll and it has us not only leading but leading by a lot and leading on every single issue that we&amp;#39;ve uh we&amp;#39;ve talked about and as I said we&amp;#39;ve become the party of common sense and I think that&amp;#39;s a very important element now common sense because what&amp;#39;s happening in the world and even in this country some of the things that took place many of them are now canceled and the rest are being cancelled as we speak but we&amp;#39;ve moved very rapidly and I think very effectively so I was honored by that poll thank you very much appreciate Mr go ahead uh please go ahead Mr President um you said before that you would like to see Russia yes go ahead your meeting in Saudi Arabia with President Putin will that happen regardless of any progress on the Ukrainian file yeah I think the meeting in Saudi Arabia was a fantastic one uh we met with the uh Crown Prince who&amp;#39;s a fantastic young guy he&amp;#39;s young but with great imagination and a tremendously respected all over the world and he goes right to the king and the king is incredible gotten to be friends with both of them very much and they want to see this ended and they&amp;#39;re going all out to make sure that it is ended uh I think Russia likewise uh I&amp;#39;ve spoken to President Putin and uh my people are dealing with him constantly and his people in particular and they want to do something I mean that&amp;#39;s what I do I do deals my whole life is deals that&amp;#39;s all I know is deals and I know when somebody wants to make and and when somebody does it I will say this before I came here there was no communication with Russia whatsoever and Russia wasn&amp;#39;t answering calls they were not talking to anybody they wouldn&amp;#39;t talk to anybody and people uh sort of accepted that as being uh that they want to go forward and just keep going without stop but when I got here one of the first calls I made was to President Putin and we were treated with great respect and they want to they want to end this war so that&amp;#39;s a big thing because I didn&amp;#39;t know if I could say that but it&amp;#39;s a big thing they want to do it and the group in the front row that I introduced they&amp;#39;re very all very active in it and we&amp;#39;re working on deals right now transactions right now and in particular the big one is to get the the war stopped whether it&amp;#39;s ceas fire or direct to an agreement uh I&amp;#39;d like to go directly to an agreement but cease fire will always happen a little bit quicker and uh every day you&amp;#39;re saving thousands or at least hundreds but thousands in some cases lives so we want to see if we can get that done very quickly uh yes for the president please thank you correspondent based in Paris question for both of you actually U Mr macron you were one of the last Western leaders to speak to Putin before Ukraine&amp;#39;s Invasion what advice what recommendation could you make to uh president Trump to make sure that um this time um you can get strong enough guarantee sorry from Putin to get a peace deal that last this time and Mr President Trump um what makes you think you can trust Putin in those negotiations thank you look I I I will never give any advice to president Trump we we have friendly and and trustful discussion but my experience uh with President Putin is the following number one I always think it&amp;#39;s good to have discussion with leaders and especially when you when when you disagree I stopped my discussion with President Putin after bua and the war crimes because I considered that h i mean we had nothing to get from him in the time now this is a chance there is a a big change because there is a new US Administration so this is a new context so there is good reason for president uh Trump to re-engage was President Putin but my experience is the following and I shared it with President Trump the team in 2014 our predecessors negotiated peace with President Putin but because of the lack of guarantees and special security guarantees President Putin violated this piece and I had several discussion especially beginning of 2022 several times seven hours with President Putin 15 days before launching of the the attack it denied everything but we didn&amp;#39;t have security guarantees so this is why being strong and having deter capacities is the only way to be sure it will be respected and I insisted on that and this is why I believe that the US has the capacity to do so and this is why I think we should never say I will never send it in boot on the ground because you g a blank shck to violate any type of uh commitment so I think it&amp;#39;s good to have discussion I think it&amp;#39;s useful to have negotiation I think it&amp;#39;s super important to go to the piece but my strong point was to say let&amp;#39;s try to get something first which is which can be assessed checked and verified and let&amp;#39;s be sure that we build sufficient guarantees on the short run and this is where we are ready to be engaged as for France a lot of my European colleagues are ready to be engaged but we do do need this American backup because this is part of the credibility of the security guarantees and this is our Collective deterent capacity and I have the feeling that the president has this capacity I think it&amp;#39;s very much to the benefit of Russia to make a deal and uh I feel that we will do that it is what it is again it&amp;#39;s a war that should have never been started it&amp;#39;s a war that would not have been started if I were president but it did start and it&amp;#39;s at a terrible level where cities are are burned down and shot down to the ground it looks like demolition sites a whole big pile of demolition sites and we got to get it stopped too many people too much Agony the whole culture is destroyed when you rip down some of those ancient really ancient or near Ancient buildings it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s so sad to see but I think it&amp;#39;s very much to the benefit of there tremendous distrust on both sides that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s good that I&amp;#39;m coming in now but I think it&amp;#39;s to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with uh go on with leading Russia in a very positive way that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what you have to do but I really believe that he wants to make a deal may be wrong but I believe he wants to make a deal uh yeah go ahead please presid Mr President next week There&amp;#39;s a key deadline for your Canada and Mexico tariffs do you expect those will go back on or do you believe those countries have done enough on the border to stop those from taking effect and for president macron I&amp;#39;m wondering if you believe that this critical minerals deal with Ukraine represents a deao security guarantee by the United States since the us would have an interest in protecting those reserves in Ukraine thank you we&amp;#39;re on time with the tariffs and it seems like that&amp;#39;s moving along very rapidly we&amp;#39;ve been mistreated very badly by many countries not just Canada and Mexico uh we&amp;#39;ve been taken advantage of we were led by in some cases fools because anybody that would sign documents like they signed where they were able to take advantage of the American people like has happened over the last long period of time except for a little four-year period that uh took place four years ago uh but uh anybody that would agree to allow this to happen to our country country uh should be ashamed of themselves now the the tariffs are going forward on time on schedule uh this is uh an abuse that took place for many many years and I&amp;#39;m not even blaming the other countries that did this I I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen I mean you know who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States took advantage of the United States on uh on manufacturing on just about everything every aspect that you could imagine they took advantage of I look at some of these agreements I&amp;#39;d read them at night and I&amp;#39;d say who would ever sign a thing like this so the terrorists will go forward yes and we&amp;#39;re going to make up a lot of territory we&amp;#39;re going to all we want is reciprocal we want reciprocity we want to have uh the same so if somebody charges us we charge them it&amp;#39;s very simple but it&amp;#39;ll be very good for our country our country will be extremely uh liquid and Rich again plus we&amp;#39;re doing other things as you know we&amp;#39;re finding tremendous waste Fraud and Abuse at levels that nobody thought possible you&amp;#39;re seeing what&amp;#39;s going on and that was also part of the Harvard poll do you agree with what president Trump is doing with Elon and others that are looking for the waste Fraud and Abuse and uh the numbers were staggering it was like uh 70% to 2% everybody wants to find out they don&amp;#39;t like it and you know the radical left or whoever it may be we start screaming about the Constitution but it has nothing to do with the Constitution it has to do with fairness to this country it has to do with being ripped off and when you read the things that all of these billions and and I mean many billions hundreds of billions of dollars has have been spent on that&amp;#39;s all you have to do is stand up here and read them I could stand up all day and read the kind of things where we&amp;#39;re spending all of this money the good news is that uh when you think of how rich a nation we can be when we get rid of this you know sometimes you&amp;#39;ll buy a company and you&amp;#39;ll see it was really well-run it&amp;#39;s they accounted for every penny well not much you can do there you got yourself a bad deal this one is the exact opposite tremendous fraud tremendous waste and and when you think of what it is you know Elon uses an expression caring if we had people that cared just cared a little bit when they did contracts when they negotiated with outside vendors for on behalf of the United States that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing now I&amp;#39;m negotiating for the people of the United States so we&amp;#39;re doing a great job of it I will say we found uh it&amp;#39;ll be hundreds of billions of dollars of of waste and Fraud and Abuse thank you please uh look I think this discussion is a very important one first because it&amp;#39;s important for the us and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between U president Trump and and president zinski second I I think it&amp;#39;s um there is a lot of economic upside for on both sides and third de facto there is a recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty a recognition of the Ukrainian interests and and this is de facto a very important alignment of Interest now the security guarantees will be negotiated in due time in a full-fledged package of a peace security but this piece as it is now written and negotiated and as this meeting is scheduled is an important step forward fully full-fledged peace agreement okay please go ahead Trump MC M Trump president MC first you say I would like to make a deal with Putin so when you do a deal it&amp;#39;s a win-win deal what are you giving to him and what is he going to give you to America and I was impressed by the way you referred to notredam and that you were impressed by the Reconstruction of notam a lot of American have sent money to Paris to participate to the Reconstruction of notredam as a president of the United States are you going to contribute to the Reconstruction of Ukraine presid maon president M what for you is the main area of progress in your meeting with President Trump can you confirm that there is an agreement to send European peacekeeping troops will France participate in that how many troops what would they be doing would this represent a great danger to send French and European troops to Ukraine well I guess it&amp;#39;s a little strange question because you ask whether or not we&amp;#39;re going to on behalf of the United States contribute to Ukraine I mean we&amp;#39;re in there for about $350 billion I think that&amp;#39;s a pretty big contribution uh I do appreciate the first part of your question however because I think they&amp;#39;ve done an incredible job with the Cathedral of notra Dum uh I think the president has done I know he headed it up and I know how hard he worked and it took a period of time but really not a long period of time considering what that was so delicate so beautiful and I was there and I saw the work and I&amp;#39;m very good at construction I know good construction I know bad construction they did a beautiful job and this man has to be given a lot of credit for that it&amp;#39;s an incredible Cathedral most people thought it couldn&amp;#39;t be saved and if it was it would have to be built in a different form and didn&amp;#39;t want to see a different form we want to see the same form that you built so I just want to congratulate you that was an amazing job I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ve gotten enough credit for it someday you will someday you will thank you D Merc thank you very much to go back to your question today&amp;#39;s discussion showed several areas of progress first we have been working a great deal with president zalinski to have a proposal that&amp;#39;s acceptable to Ukraine president Trump has confirmed that he will be meeting with President zalinsky very soon to finalize the agreement on critical minerals and rare Earths and to speak together about that matter that&amp;#39;s a very important step forward the second thing is that during our discussions we were able to go into some of the details about the proposal that we have just made to have a truce a peace and be able to measure that and then structure our discussions on that basis France and several other European countries along with Ukraine are hard at work to build this lasting peace with very specific points including security guarantees uh the territories that belong to Ukraine the issue of reconstruction the economy and critical minerals we&amp;#39;ve been able to go into the details of those proposals the third area of progress which uh really Mark a turning point is the fact that we were able to talk about the details of the security guarantees and the president has shown this over the past few days and he said so a moment ago we want peace he wants peace we want peace peace swiftly but we don&amp;#39;t want an agreement that is weak the fact that there are Europeans that are ready to engage to uh provide for these security guarantees and now there&amp;#39;s a clear American message that the US as an ally is ready to provide that solidarity for that approach that&amp;#39;s a turning point in my view and that is one of the great areas of progress that we&amp;#39;ve made during this trip and during this discussion when it comes to troops in the past a year ago specifically we saw a reason to talk about sending troops uh to for strategic re regions today when we talk about troops we&amp;#39;re talking about sending them in after we&amp;#39;ve negotiated a lasting peace and once we have that solid lasting peace that&amp;#39;s part of an agreement signed by Ukraine signed by Russia and for which we will provide the guarantees then at that point and recently France has worked with the UK uh to provide its contributions we&amp;#39;ve worked on plans we&amp;#39;ve worked with our militaries not to go to the front lines not to go into occupied territories but as a show of support to show that we have a negotiated piece signed by both sides and that is a piece we will preserve so these would be peaceful deployments of troops not for combat these would be deployments of an assurance Force they would be limited but they show solidarity I have also spoken with all of our allies and there are European and non-european allies who are ready and willing to take part in that effort countries have helped Ukraine maintain its military capabilities in terms of the number of soldiers it has equipment whereas others have provided logistical support on the ground the question is whether or in what form the US will contribute and during our discussions and during the discussions with Russia we&amp;#39;ve understood that this would be acceptable to Russia and that&amp;#39;s a very important area of progress and that means that in this context the Europeans will shoulder their part of the burden their share of the burden we have a strong Alliance that we&amp;#39;ve built over the decades we have our solidarity and we have deterrence capacities what does it mean would it be dangerous if there is an agreement signed by Ukraine and Russia thanks to the efforts of President Trump and if we provide the guarantees and Russia violates the agreement then it would be in conflict with everyone who is engaged in the peace process and that is a change that was something we did not see in the past that&amp;#39;s not what we saw in 2014 so that is the real change that we&amp;#39;re marking we have this deterrent capacity on the American side we have the capacity for engagement on the European side and that&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;re going to continue working on together it&amp;#39;s not dangerous but it&amp;#39;s credible it&amp;#39;s less dangerous than things that could happen in the long term and I think this is what we need to do to ensure security and I say this very clearly we&amp;#39;re also talking about security for Europe an I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for weeks now if we do not guarantee the security of this territory within Europe then how can we guarantee our own security for one and all we live just 1,500 kilometers from Ukraine and the Germans and polish are even closer so our collective security is important we need to answer this call for Europeans to be more engaged and Americans will be there still in solidarity Europeans are working for their collective security but I really think this was a turning point today in our discussions Emanuel thank you very much great job and it&amp;#39;s been wonderful being with you say hello to your beautiful wife and we will see you again soon we&amp;#39;ll be speaking off and we&amp;#39;ll get this thing worked out we&amp;#39;re going to get it done so important and great job thank you we have been watching president Trump and French president Emanuel macron hold a joint press conference there uh this Q&amp;amp;A with the Press came after a bilateral meeting between the two leaders at the White House and leaders asked multiple questions about uh Ukraine of course today being uh year three of the invasion today marking three years since the Russian invasion uh French president macron talking a lot about security guarantees that the Europeans are going to be looking for of course the European many leaders feel like they have shut out of negotiations uh that President Trump has said that his administration is having with Vladimir Putin not with Ukrainian President Vladimir zalinsky the two also asked questions about tariffs uh president mcon saying that the economies of the United States and Europe are incredibly intertwined and also notably uh president macron saying Europeans need to do more for defense in Europe and share the security burden your country has been carrying certainly something that we have heard from president Trump time time again let&amp;#39;s go to CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O&amp;#39;Keefe Ed uh what are your takeaways I I wonder if somebody was sort of playing with a bingo card the the term security guarantees would have come up quite a bit probably not Lindsay but this is a an important meeting between these two leaders macron of course now sort of the senior Statesman of Europe eager to bring his continent together understanding that with the United States&amp;#39;s support for Ukraine and for Europe security perhaps waning at least publicly that they now need to be doing much more so macron is here today the British prime minister kir starmer is here later in the week both of them expected to press the case for ensuring continued us involvement engagement in the situation in Ukraine and as you heard mrcon say leave security guarantees in place so that Putin can no longer or or can never in this instance walk over them and ignore any kind of negotiated settlement or any other kind of negotiation pointing out that back in 2014 when their predecessors did so there were no security guarantees in place which is what led to the invasion and the Takeover of Crimea and would have essentially led to the war that started 3 years ago today um this was a uh perhaps not as long a meeting as we might have thought it could have been uh but they did see each other obviously this morning for an early morning G7 video conference uh mcon and Biden were together in the ovall office for that as they met with the other members of that organization and and then the two of them meeting this afternoon with their counterparts here at the at the white house uh president again suggesting that he is destined for some kind of a meeting with President zalinsky of Ukraine about an agreement to be able to extract Ukrainian Goods or minerals Rare Earth minerals uh for the US&amp;#39;s use at some point uh and then rule out again possibly meeting with President Putin at some point but noted that his people are in touch with Putin&amp;#39;s people about eventually setting that up so no firm resolution today but an important meeting that had to happen that Europe was eager to see happen and macron can go back to France and to Europe more broadly now and say at least for now the United States is still engaged and that&amp;#39;s what we want and and by going back and saying we&amp;#39;re boosting our security commitments as well that may be enough to earn Trump&amp;#39;s uh pleasure and support for now well on the president had repeated that the US is outspending Europe by billions of dollars in the war but according to the Keel Institute for the world economy Europe is actually outspending the US when it comes to the totality of Aid humanitarian economic and Military the US still outspends Europe when it comes solely on military aid that said did President macron&amp;#39;s tone strike you perhaps as more conciliatory than we might have expected no these two have had a long-standing relationship remember mcon and him uh were counterparts during the first Trump Administration so they have a rapport they they have an understanding uh that goes back several years now and it&amp;#39;s always been dear old and uh and far more personable and and then they have that those weird handshakes as they did earlier today in the Oval Office they&amp;#39;d had them in the past about whether you know are they trying to outs squeeze each other it&amp;#39;s unclear but either way it&amp;#39;s designed to show the world that they&amp;#39;re buddies and uh and that continued again today and you&amp;#39;re right the president suggested is 350 billion it&amp;#39;s not nearly that much it&amp;#39;s about 183 billion in counting in US military aid uh he gets to the 350 through other math uh but not accurate math a and you&amp;#39;re right when you add up the European military and humanitarian assistance in direct Aid and in loans that will be paid back as mcon pointed out earlier today some of it will be uh it far exceeds what the United States has paid so far some news today also about tariffs the president asked about those tariffs against Canada and Mexico will they go on what did the president say that they will and they are set to begin next week and they&amp;#39;re set to begin next week just as canidate at least it&amp;#39;s Liberal Party has headed to the polls to pick its new leader and essentially its new prime minister so it remains a major campaign issue and cause of concern to the north as uh Canadian provinces prepare reciprocal tariffs uh in response should they come uh but the president holding firm there saying that those tariffs are set to come and that may once again send Jitters through the global markets and we&amp;#39;ll see if it leads to another round of conversations with the leaders of Canada and Mexico Edo Keef thank you"

there what they mean for all of this and Puck founding partner in Washington correspondent Julia aafi so macron there sounded very positive uh V he was clearly trying to play to Donald Trump&amp;#39;s vanity uh talking about how good of a partner he&amp;#39;s been the memories they&amp;#39;ve had together he was also talking about how Europe needed to stand up more talking about the minerals deal that Donald Trump wants to make with Ukraine widely panned by foreign policy experts but some U moves from macron to say Hey listen this is not such a bad idea can you just straighten this out for us what what can we say it appears has come from this meeting right because to a certain extent there&amp;#39;s an acknowledgement that if a rare earth minerals deal were to be signed between Ukraine and United States effectively that would increase the Us&amp;#39;s own interest in having uh what would amount to a security agreement to protect Ukraine in the future because they would be protecting their own resources and of course that is where you see President MCR wholly understanding that they are negotiating with somebody and president Trump whose commitment to Ukraine is rather imperative to the future of Ukraine&amp;#39;s defenses and the Region&amp;#39;s defenses against further Russian aggression and the posture I think that you saw not only during this press conference but also that 30 minutes in the Oval Office just about two hours ago I think is striking because in many ways you saw president macron tout the relationship that the G7 has in their phone call that they engage in this morning but then there also the Bap between President mcon and president Trump here this afternoon and the one moment where you saw him interject was when President Trump boosted the idea that somehow the US had invested almost three times the amount of Aid to Ukraine than the EU has and that the EU was doing it in the form of a loan when the US was getting the bad end of the deal when President macron jumped in to set the record straight and saying that the EU has in fact contributed 60% of the financial assistance to Ukraine&amp;#39;s efforts in that it has not been in the form of a loan to which you saw president Trump sort of shrug there but that was the first time that we have seen a foreign leader really push back against a claim made by the president but other than that you saw by and large him wholly understanding in their in his agreement with President Trump in the direction which these negotiations are moving Julie was also interesting is that um macron who who to be fair had um kept up communications with Vladimir Putin longer than pretty much anybody else after the war started he said his line was what happened to buah the slaughter there um the raping the the awful stories that happened um from Russian soldiers on ukrainians in bukah and that&amp;#39;s when he stopped but now he&amp;#39;s saying on this three-year anniversary that it is time to re-engage with Vladimir Putin would he be saying that if um Donald Trump did not win the white house uh I doubt he would be I think that this is basically him responding as he said to a new American reality he addressed this headon in this press conference he said I stopped talking to him because he was lying essentially and uh to Von&amp;#39;s Point uh mrcon talked about how we tried to negotiate peace with him in 2014 and he didn&amp;#39;t even have to finish the rest of the sentence because we know where we are um now 11 years later we&amp;#39;re still uh Ukraine is still at war with Russia right despite any negotiations Putin has entered into which is what everybody has been warning about but I guess uh macron&amp;#39;s point is if Trump is going to be negotiating with Putin anyway then Europe should be at the table because a it affects Europe&amp;#39;s security first and foremost um at least when it comes to the US and the west and also because um they have underwritten 60% of Ukrainian Aid so you know it&amp;#39;s either you can condemn the talks all you want or you you know join them and try to get your point across get yourself H been sanctions on Russia now for three years pretty heavy sanctions but they have been able to continue waging this war they&amp;#39;ve been getting help from the North Koreans they&amp;#39;ve been getting help from the Iranians um and from China uh could they continue on that path if the US was still standing by NATO still standing by Ukraine staying on the path it had been on until Donald Trump was elected would there come a point where Vladimir Putin would be left with no other option than to pull out of the war himself uh I I doubt that there have been a several prognoses that 2025 was going to be the year that the going got easier for Ukraine both because some of the weapons they ordered early on in the War uh again American weapons made in America by Americans in America would be coming online would be uh shipped to Ukraine finally and because Russia would be running out of money it&amp;#39;s not just that the North Koreans and the Chinese are helping them it&amp;#39;s also that India for example is buying their oil and uh countries like turkey other Central Asian countries like Kazakhstan Armenia are helping Russia bypass sanctions by being kind of Shadow importers for uh for Russia and one of the reasons that you Russia is able to pay for this war to continue to pay for this war is it does have vast uh energy resources that the world still needs and most of the world uh does not really care about this war the way that the West does um and Russia&amp;#39;s just spending spending spending inflation is crazy in Russia right now it it&amp;#39;s just been the economy has been flushed with cash because of this defense spending and there have been prognoses that this money would run out but I don&amp;#39;t know that that alone would be enough for Putin to stop fighting because he doesn&amp;#39;t care about economics first he cares about this imperialist project first so the question is if the US does completely back out and I know French president Emanuel macron is saying you know we had a good meeting today and we I believe this is a turning point but Donald Trump is very famous for always agreeing with the last person that he that he talks to so we&amp;#39;ll see what happens after this if Europe had to stand up on its own I&amp;#39;ll give this question to rap Sanchez are they going to be able to do that because the question has been is there public support among European nations to keep helping Ukraine and I think the German election was something of a test of that can can you um can you infer anything from what happened there so Katie anecdote data but you&amp;#39;ll be able to see behind me the iconic Brandenburg gate lit up here in the very heart of Berlin in the colors of the Ukrainian flag and actually just finished here was a very large very noisy rally of several thousand Germans turning out to show their solidarity with Ukraine three years since the fullscale invasion I would say these people were here to protest President Putin but a lot of them were also there to protest president Trump we saw a lot of signs in English one of them saying Putin&amp;#39;s Russia is the aggressor aggressor in Ukraine which is a point pointed message given that over the weekend several senior Trump Administration officials really were not able to say those words that Putin&amp;#39;s Russia started this war in terms of capabilities Katie the Europeans are nowhere near where they would need to be to stands alone militarily without the United States they&amp;#39;re very open about that absolutely critical assets like air refueling missile defense uh certain types of long-term missiles longrange missiles the Europeans are just almost completely dependent on the United States but what you are seeing here in Europe is an increasing sense of urgency about breaking that dependence it was very interesting watching the French president from here in Berlin taking a sort of non-confrontational approach to Donald Trump trying to flatter him where he could Point towards areas of agreement because the likely next leader of Germany last night just minutes after exit polls pointed to his election victory was absolutely blunt in his assessment of the crisis in the US European relationship his name is Friedrich Merz he is uh from the center right he&amp;#39;s the head of the Christian democrats Angela merkel&amp;#39;s old party uh his party got the most votes they are likely going to lead the next coalition government but just a few minutes after that exit poll he went into a German television studio and he said it is very clear to him that the Trump Administration does not care about the fate of Europe he said is is going to be his top priority as the leader of Europe&amp;#39;s largest economy to strengthen Europe so it can forge an independent path from the United States he said he&amp;#39;s not at all confident that NATO will be able to continue in its current form and he talked about the fact that both vice president Vance and Elon Musk pretty openly supported the far right in this German election and he went on to say that the election interference from Washington was just as shameful as the election inter from Moscow so these are very Stark words from a traditional American Ally from a leader on the center right who really feels that the relationship between the United States and its NATO allies in Western Europe is in a very very dark place right now"

      "captions": "we are seeing that French president Emanuel macron and also president Trump entering the White House to deliver that joint statement let&amp;#39;s take a listen I&amp;#39;m delighted to welcome president mcon back to the White House we&amp;#39;ve been together quite often but not that often in the white house we honored the president first lady of France uh not so long ago it was a beautiful evening and uh we will not soon forget it that was a beautiful day and evening and many fond memories I also want to thank Emanuel for hosting me in Paris last December after a historic election win to witness the reopening of the spectacular notredam Cathedral where you did an outstanding job in bringing it back together that was a sad day watching that burn and 5 years later you had it up and it was uh they say more beautiful than it was before so I think that&amp;#39;s a great achievement that was not easy France is America&amp;#39;s oldest Ally our cherished partnership has been a force for Freedom prosperity and peace from the very beginning we&amp;#39;re now working on some very interesting developments one in particular as you know the war between Russia and Ukraine in the American Revolution French support helped us to seize our destiny as an independent nation in the first and second world wars our citizens shed blood together on the battlefields of Europe and I&amp;#39;ll never forget joining president macron six years ago in the 75th anniversary of D-Day that was someday the purpose of our meeting today is to end another battle a really horrible one a war something that we haven&amp;#39;t seen since the second world war that is ravaging European soil the deadliest and most destructive conflict that one can imagine I&amp;#39;ve seen the pictures I&amp;#39;ve seen the set photos and and lots of other photos and it&amp;#39;s a horrible thing that&amp;#39;s happening thousands of people are dying a week this very day is the third anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine which would never have happened if I was president that was not going to happen the horrors of this gruesome and bloody war can scarcely be overestimated hundreds of thousands of people Russians and ukrainians in particular have needlessly died an entire generation of ukrainians and Russian men has been decimated 1,000 year old cities have been turned into Rubble those beautiful spires that you used to see there they were most beautiful in the world turned into Rubble those beautiful spires that you used to see there they were most beautiful in the world they say are lying in heaps of rubble blasted to Smither it&amp;#39;s time to end this Blood letting and restore peace and I think we&amp;#39;re going to do it we&amp;#39;ve had some great conversations including with Russia since my return to the White House we&amp;#39;ve made more progress toward that goal in one month than occurred in the past three years and I&amp;#39;ve spoken with both President Putin and president zalinski and again a lot of a lot of good things toward peace are happening moving it I think pretty quickly last week Secretary of State Marco Rubio National Security adviser Michael walson special Envoy Steve witkoff conducted successful talks in Saudi Arabia with the delegation from Russia and I&amp;#39;d like to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and uh the king and Muhammad uh great people they really working hard to get this done our focus is on achieving a ceas fire as soon as possible and ultimately a permanent peace my meeting with president mcon today was another important step forward in that in that sphere because uh he&amp;#39;s been very much involved right from the beginning in trying to get it over with we&amp;#39;re going to get it done I believe that Emanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues Chief among them is uh this is the right time it may be the only time you know that&amp;#39;s a very interesting interesting and horrible situation and that could evolve into a third world war we&amp;#39;re not going to let that happen should have never started but it did and uh what a mess what a horrible bloody mess I&amp;#39;m also pleased that President mcon agrees that the cost and burden of securing the peace must be borne by the nations of Europe Not Alone by the United States and Europe must take that Central role in assuring long-term security of Ukraine which they want to do and that&amp;#39;s not a very big step the big step is what&amp;#39;s going to happen over the next few weeks the United States has put up far more aid for Ukraine than any other Nation hundreds of billions of dollars we&amp;#39;ve spent more than 300 billion and Europe has spent about a 100 100 billion that&amp;#39;s a big difference and at some point we should equalize but hopefully won&amp;#39;t have to worry about that we have other things happening that maybe take that out of the realm of necessity and while we&amp;#39;ve given vast amounts of military aid and money in form of Grants much of Europe&amp;#39;s contribution has been economic relief structured as loans for which they&amp;#39;ll be repaid like the Europeans I believe that taxpayers and the United States also deserve to recoup the Colossal amounts of money that we&amp;#39;ve sent the previous administration never even thought of that they didn&amp;#39;t think of a lot of things like why did they let it start in the first place that is why we must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and RAR us and various other things as security and I think that that&amp;#39;s happening I think we&amp;#39;ve made a lot of progress I had a report just given to me before walking in that uh We&amp;#39;ve made Emanuel a great deal of progress toward getting that I&amp;#39;ve been elected by the American people to restore common sense to Washington and indeed to the world and I believe strongly that it&amp;#39;s in the best interest of the United States the best interest in Europe the best interest of Ukraine and indeed the best interest of Russia to Stop The Killing now and bring the world to peace my Administration is making a decisive break with the foreign policy failures of the past administration and frankly the past I ran against a very foolish foreign policy establishment and their recklessness has led to the death of many many people under our Administration we&amp;#39;re forging A New Path that promotes peace around the world and when I left office for the first Administration first term we had no Wars we had no problems we didn&amp;#39;t have October 7th with Israel we didn&amp;#39;t have Russia and Ukraine going at it we didn&amp;#39;t have the problems in other parts of the Middle East we didn&amp;#39;t have inflation it was a whole different world and you know what else we didn&amp;#39;t have millions of people pouring through our borders many of them criminals released from other nations and put right into our land murderers and drug dealers gangs we didn&amp;#39;t have any of that it&amp;#39;s a different time but now we have it and we&amp;#39;re fixing it we&amp;#39;ll fix it all up we&amp;#39;ll get it done as quickly as possible and we&amp;#39;ve made a great deal of progress people are saying it was the best month for a president in our country&amp;#39;s history I hope that&amp;#39;s right but I feel it&amp;#39;s right we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve done a lot of things in a very short period of time four weeks as I&amp;#39;ve said before it&amp;#39;s my hope that my greatest Legacy however will be as a peacemaker and a unifier I want to bring peace not War I think president mcon for joining us today in this urgent work we&amp;#39;re doing we have some wonderful people up front right here that have worked so hard Steve witkoff thank you very much Michael walz thank you Scott thank you very much and JD thank you they&amp;#39;ve really done a they&amp;#39;ve really done a job they worked very hard it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s a real passion to get this war ended and I&amp;#39;d like to uh now invite Emanuel to say a few words and then we&amp;#39;ll take questions and again Emanuel it&amp;#39;s a great honor to have you with us at the White House thank you very much please thank you thank you Mr President thank you Don ministers ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen I&amp;#39;ll be saying a few words in French thank you very much Mr President dear Donald for your hospitality and for this visit as you mentioned we have had the opportunity to meet over the past few years since your first term we&amp;#39;ve been able to discuss matters in Paris and also here at the White House and it has always been a great joy to do that and I would like to commend you thank you Mr President for extending this friendship to France and taking part in the ceremony at notredam that you mentioned before it was a great honor for the French people to reopen the cathedral to the rest of the world and your presence was a testament to that friendship as the president said this friendship dates back to the Revolutionary War since the beginning of the United States and whenever we&amp;#39;ve needed we&amp;#39;ve been able to come together and be on the right side we&amp;#39;ve been able to be United to defend peace and sovereignty namely in the two world wars that marked the 20th century Laing and to the many Americans who landed on Omaha Beach and we spoke earlier before and you mentioned that one of those gentleman was able to visit you here one of the veterans this is part of History which puts us in the world that we are in today and as the president just said there are many challenges in this world and over the past few days we have one main objective which is the geopolitical situation Mr President I really wish to thank you for making changes to your schedule to meet with us so quickly I think we&amp;#39;ve made very substantive steps forward during our discussions and this is a major step in what we&amp;#39;re experiencing today we had a video conference with all of the G7 leaders which was an opportunity for us to discuss this matter 3 days after the uh Russian Mo in Ukraine and to express our support for president sininsky to the Ukrainian people but also to speak and share about our desire for a lasting peace this is what we have spoken about very forcibly over the past thought that war was only going to last a few weeks when it broke out in 2022 we admire greatly the courage of the Ukrainian people and Mr President I wish to thank you for this you mentioned that there our responsibilities on Europe side and indeed we have invested 128 billion in Aid to Ukraine and the ukrainians Ukraine has been able to hold the front of our collective security it&amp;#39;s fought over these past few years for its independence and for its sovereignty but also for our collective security I think that no one in this room wants to live in a world where it&amp;#39;s the law of the strongest and international borders can be violated from one day to the next by anyone over the past few hours and as you mentioned this uh Mr President we&amp;#39;ve been able to see a few things take shape first of all allow me to commend you on your decision to work with president sininsky and to conclude this agreement that&amp;#39;s so important for the US and Ukraine on rare Earths critical minerals but also having substantive conversations with president seninsky during this key phase of achieving this deal which is a major commitment to Ukraine&amp;#39;s sovereignty and I think that&amp;#39;s very commendable we also have a shared desire to build peace we will have this responsibility this is 10 years after the war started in Crimea and then we saw the events in Donas in the donbas region and along the northern part of the country we want to save lives we want to bring prisoners back and bring back families and children because there&amp;#39;s also humanitarian tragedy affecting the Ukrainian people we had lengthy discussions with the president and we spoke about our desire to bring an end to conflicts to have a truce that is measurable verifiable and that enables negotiation of a lasting peace where we will discuss not only Ukraine&amp;#39;s reconstruction its territories but also the security guarantees meaning maintaining peace over the long term as I said to the president we&amp;#39;ve experienced Peace Accords that were only ceasefires without ensuring security guarantees Minsk one and we want to make sure this doesn&amp;#39;t happen again and I know that the president has expressed the desire to be a player for peace in the region I&amp;#39;ve spoken with some 30 European leaders and allies in recent days we want to bring together these allies allies rather and share the same vision this peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine it must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders regarding the issues it affects that affects it rather but it is also a country in which we need to shoulder our responsibility so that we ensure security and stability for Ukraine and for the entire region and for us Europeans this is an existential issue we also spoke about these issues at l with the president we&amp;#39;ve worked with president senin and gotten to some of the details of the various phases of the negotiation and we&amp;#39;ve also been able to speak about some of this work with our British Partners to talk about deployments of Peace forces on Ukrainian soil which are part of these security guarantees other countries are ready to join in this effort solidarity and support from the US will be crucial to this and I thank you Mr President for beginning to work with us on this issue and the agreement that you are preparing to sign with you Ukraine and with all the discussions we&amp;#39;ve had are very solid guarantees that we are understood and that we have the same wish peace as soon as possible lasting Solid Peace for everyone and the renewal of of an international situation where we are all able to shoulder our responsibilities Europeans shouldering their responsibilities alongside their American Allies who will shoulder their own responsibilities I also wanted to be very clear Mr President about Europe&amp;#39;s commitment we have committed to building a lasting peace as Europeans we have committed to being stakeholders in these security guarantees and we are also well aware that Europeans need to do more for security in Europe for defense in Europe and to more fairly share the security bden burden that your country has been carrying for so many years Mr President you know how much friendship I show towards you and I have towards you since your first term Europe is very cleare eyed about this we know what we need to do Europeans given the threats surrounding us and the responsibilities that we must shoulder we spoke about the Versa agenda which allowed the Europeans to take a historic step and increase their Investments Europeans are ready to do even more and to go even farther and several leaders said that to me before I came here to meet you Mr President dear Donald you spoke about this peace through strength we fully share that because we must recognize the sacrifices made by the Ukrainian people and what we owe to them the president and I also spoke about economic matters and our desire to see more prosperity in the United States and in Europe we had discussions which will be carried on by our teams our ministers and searies to flesh out some of those ideas but the idea is to have Fair competition and no bias within competition between our Industries now the American and European economies are extremely intertwined some 1.5 billion in trade trillion rather in goods and services and I know you&amp;#39;ve spoken about wanting to look at the balance of payments we also have a trade def deficit and I know that we need to look not only at Goods but also digital items and goods which you export and we want to make a sincere commitment towards Fair competition where we have smooth trade and more Investments you already invest a great deal in France and France is the fifth most the fifth largest investor in the United States and I would like to recognize here all of the American investors who announced Investments some 120 billion dollars that were announced at the AI Summit this is our wish we want to have more Prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic we have a shared agenda in that regard we also spoke about the midle East among other subjects and here again we have the same desire we don&amp;#39;t want to see Iran obtain nuclear weapons we don&amp;#39;t [Music] want or rather we want an approach with Partners in the region that we can trust given Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear activities we want to limit its ballistic capabilities and avoid any type of regional destabilization with respect to Syria and Iraq we also share the same we don&amp;#39;t want to see Islamic terrorist groups resume any of their activities because for some time our armies have very bravely been engaged in the Gulf as you have led and contributions have been significant and helped stability in the region and I say this with great sincerity uh France was affected by a terrorist attack in 2015 which was linked to the terrorist activity in Syria and we are in that region at your side to work for more security ladies and gentlemen we had extremely productive discussions this morning during the conference and we spoke with our ministers and counselors and advisors and I wish to say after speaking with President Trump I am fully believe that there is a path forward we share the same beliefs we know what work needs to be done in the weeks to come we will work on that our teams will come together in various formats to make sure that we have this solid lasting peace with great strength Mr President thank you so much for welcoming me here today thank you so much for these productive discussions and for your commitment thank you dear Donald thank you very much thank youman thank you very okay thank you very much Brian would you like to ask a question go ahead Mr welcome president I just want to touch upon real quickly the Harvard poll that came out that had thank you very much the Harvard poll that came out had you up nine plus points and all of your agenda that you ran on you&amp;#39;re accomplishing that you got the support of the American people including stopping the war in Ukraine if you can comment on the latest Harvard poll I appreciate that well I was honored by it it was a big poll and it&amp;#39;s a usually a poll that leans on the other side of things the other side of the world so to speak but the Harvard poll is a respected poll and it has us not only leading but leading by a lot and leading on every single issue that we&amp;#39;ve uh we&amp;#39;ve talked about and as I said we&amp;#39;ve become the party of common sense and I think that&amp;#39;s a very important element now common sense because what&amp;#39;s happening in the world and even in this country some of the things that took place many of them are now canceled and the rest are being canceled as we speak but we&amp;#39;ve moved very rapidly and I think very effectively so I was honored by that poll thank you very much appreciate it Mr go ahead uh please go ahead Mr President um you said before that you would like to see [Music] Russia yes go ahead [Music] with you meeting in Saudi Arabia with President Putin will that happen regardless of any progress on the Ukrainian pile yeah I think the meeting in Saudi Arabia was a fantastic one uh we met with the uh CR Prince was fantastic young guy he&amp;#39;s young but with great imagination and a tremendously respected all over the world and he goes right to the king and the king is incredible gotten to be friends with both of them very much and they want to see this ended and they&amp;#39;re going all out to make sure that it is ended uh I think Russia likewise I&amp;#39;ve spoken to President Putin and uh my people are dealing with him constantly and his people in particular and they want to do something I mean that&amp;#39;s what I do I do deals my whole life is deals that&amp;#39;s all I know is deals and I know when somebody wants to make and and when somebody doesn&amp;#39;t I will say this before I came here there was no communication with Russia whatsoever and Russia wasn&amp;#39;t answering calls they were not talking to anybody they wouldn&amp;#39;t talk to anybody and people uh sort of accepted that as being uh that they want to go forward and just keep going without stop but when I got here one of the first calls I made was to President Putin and we were treated with great respect and they want to they want to end this war so that&amp;#39;s a big thing because I didn&amp;#39;t know if I could say that but it&amp;#39;s a big thing they want to do it and the group in the front row that I introduced they&amp;#39;re very all very active in it and we&amp;#39;re working on deals right now transactions right now and in particular the big one is to get the the war stopped whether it&amp;#39;s cease fire or direct to an agreement uh I&amp;#39;d like to go directly to an agreement but ceas fire will always happen a little bit quicker and uh every day you&amp;#39;re saving thousands or at least hundreds but thousands in some cases lives so we want to see if we can get that done very quickly uh yes for the president please yes thank you correspondent based in Paris question for both of you actually U Mr macron you were one of the last Western leaders to speak to Putin before Ukraine&amp;#39;s Invasion what advice what recommendation could you make to uh president Trump to make sure that um this time um uh you can get strong enough guarantees sorry from Putin to get a peace deal that last this time and Mr uh president Trump um what makes you think you can trust Putin in Z those negotiations thank you look I I I will never give any advice to president Trump we we have friendly and and trustful discussion but my experience uh with President Putin is the following number one I always think it&amp;#39;s good to have discussion with other leaders and especially when you when when you disagree I stopped my discussion with President Putin after bua and the war crimes because I considered that I mean we had nothing to get from him in the time now this is a chance there is a a big change because there is a new US Administration so this is a new context so there is good reason for president Trump to re-engage was President Putin but my experience is the following and I shared it with president Trump and the team in 2014 our predecessors negotiated peace with President Putin but because of the lack of guarantees and Specialty security guarantees President Putin violated this pieace and I had several discussion especially beginning of 2022 several times seven hours with President Putin 15 days before launching of the the attack it denied everything but we didn&amp;#39;t have security guarantees so this is why being strong and having deteran capacities is the only way to be sure it will be respected and I insisted on that and this is why I believe that the US has the capacity to do so and this is why I think we should never say I will never send it in Boots on the ground because you g a blank check to violate any type of uh commitment so I think it&amp;#39;s good to have discussion I think it&amp;#39;s useful to have negotiation I think it&amp;#39;s super important to go to the piece but my strong point was to say let&amp;#39;s try to get something first which is which can be assessed checked and verified and let&amp;#39;s be sure that we build sufficient guarantees on the short run and this is where we are ready to be engaged as for France a lot of my European colleagues are ready to be engaged but we do do need this American backup because this is part of the credibility of the security guarantees and this is our Collective deteran capacity and I have the feeling that the Pres has this capacity I think it&amp;#39;s very much to the benefit of Russia to make a deal and uh I feel that we will do that it is what it is again it&amp;#39;s a war that should have never been started it&amp;#39;s a war that would not have been started if I were president but it did start and it&amp;#39;s at a terrible level where cities are are burned down and shot down to the ground it looks like demolition sites a whole big pile of demolition sites and we got to get it stopped too many people too much Agony the whole culture is destroyed when you rip down some of those ancient really ancient or near Ancient building it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s so sad to see but I think it&amp;#39;s very much to the benefit of there tremendous distrust on both sides that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s good that I&amp;#39;m coming in now but I think it&amp;#39;s to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with uh go on with leading Russia in a very positive way that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what you have to do but I really believe that he wants to make a deal may be wrong but I believe he wants to make a deal uh yeah go ahead Please Mr Mr President next week There&amp;#39;s a key deadline for your Canada and Mexico tariffs do you expect those will go believe those countries have done enough on the border to stop those from taking effect and for president macron I&amp;#39;m wondering if you believe that this critical minerals deal with Ukraine represents a deao security guarantee by the United States since the us would have an interest in protecting those reserves in Ukraine thank you we&amp;#39;re on time with the tariffs and it seems like that&amp;#39;s moving along very rapidly we&amp;#39;ve been mistreated very badly by many countries not just Canada and Mexico uh we&amp;#39;ve been taken advantage of we were led by in some cases fools because anybody that would sign documents like they signed where they were able to take advantage of the American people like has happened over the last long period of time except for a little four-year period that took place four years ago uh but uh anybody that would agree to allow this to happened to our country uh should be ashamed of themselves now the the tariffs are going forward on time on schedule uh this is uh an abuse that took place for many many years and I&amp;#39;m not even blaming the other countries that did this I I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen I mean you know who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States took advantage of the United States on uh on manufacturing on just about everything every aspect that you can imagine they took advantage of I look at some of these agreements I&amp;#39;d read them at night and I&amp;#39;d say who would ever sign a thing like this so the terorists will go forward yes and we&amp;#39;re going to make up a lot of territory we&amp;#39;re going to all we want is reciprocal we want reciprocity we want to have uh the same so if somebody charges us we charge them it&amp;#39;s very simple but uh it&amp;#39;ll be very good for our country our country will be extremely uh liquid and Rich again plus we&amp;#39;re doing other things as you know we&amp;#39;re finding tremendous waste Fraud and Abuse at levels that nobody thought possible you&amp;#39;re seeing what&amp;#39;s going on and uh that was also part of the Harvard poll do you agree with what president Trump is doing with Elon and others that are looking for the waste Fraud and Abuse and uh the numbers were staggering it was like uh 70% to 2% everybody wants to find out they don&amp;#39;t like it and you know the radical left whoever it may be start screaming about the Constitution but it has nothing to do with the Constitution it has to do with fairness to this country it has to do with being ripped off and when you read the things that all of these billions and and I mean many billions hundreds of billions of dollars has have been spent on that&amp;#39;s all you have to do is stand up here and read them I could stand up all day and read the kind of things where we&amp;#39;re spending all of this money the good news is that uh when you think of how rich a nation we can be when we get rid of this you know sometimes you&amp;#39;ll buy a company and you&amp;#39;ll see it was really well-run it&amp;#39;s they accounted for every penny well not much you can do there you got yourself a bad deal this one is the exact opposite tremendous fraud tremendous waste and and when you think of what it is you know Elon uses an expression caring if we had people that cared just cared a little bit when they did contracts when they negotiated with outside vendors for on behalf of the United that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing now I&amp;#39;m negotiating for the people of the United States so we&amp;#39;re doing a great job of it I will say we found uh it&amp;#39;ll be hundreds of billions of dollars of of waste and Fraud and Abuse thank you please uh look I think this discussion is a very important one first because it&amp;#39;s important for the us and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between U president Trump and and president zinski second I I think it&amp;#39;s um there is a lot of economic upside for on both sides and third de facto there is a recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty a recognition of the Ukrainian interests and and this is de facto a very important alignment of Interest now the security guarantees will be negotiated in due time in a full-fledged package of a peace security but this piece as it is now written and negotiated and as this meeting is scheduled is an important step forward full-fledged peace agreement okay please president Trump president Trump president M you say I would like to make a deal with Putin so when you do a deal it&amp;#39;s a win-win deal what are you giving to him and what is he going to give you to America and I was impressed by the way you referred to notredam and that you were impressed by the reconstruction of notredam a lot of American have sent money to Paris to participate to the Reconstruction of notredam as a president of the United States are you going to contribute to the Reconstruction of Ukraine pres maon president mcon what for you is the main area of progress in your meeting with President Trump can you confirm that there is an agreement to send European peacekeeping troops will France participate in that how many troops what would they be doing would this represent a great danger to send French and European troops to Ukraine well I guess it&amp;#39;s a little strange question because you ask whether or not we&amp;#39;re going to on behalf of the United States contribute to Ukraine I mean we&amp;#39;re in there for about $350 billion I think that&amp;#39;s a pretty big contribution uh I do appreciate the first part of your question however because I think they&amp;#39;ve done an incredible job with the Cathedral of notredam uh I think the president has done I know he headed it up and I know how hard he worked and it took a period of time but really not a long period of time considering what that was so delicate so beautiful and I was there and I saw the work and I&amp;#39;m very good at construction I know good construction I know bad construction they did a beautiful job and this man has to be given a lot of credit for that it&amp;#39;s an incredible Cathedral most people thought it couldn&amp;#39;t be saved and if it was it would have to be built in a different form and we didn&amp;#39;t want to see a different form we wanted to see the same form that you built so I just want to congratulate you that was an amazing job I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ve gotten enough credit for it someday you will someday you will thank you D thank you very much to go back to your question today&amp;#39;s discussion showed several areas of progress we have been working a great deal with president zinski to have a proposal that&amp;#39;s acceptable to Ukraine president Trump has confirmed that he will be meeting with President zinski very soon to finalize the agreement on critical minerals and rare Earths and to speak together about that matter that&amp;#39;s a very important step forward the second thing is that during our discussions we were able to go into some of the details about the proposal that we have just made to have a truth a peace and be able to measure that and then structure our discussions on that basis France and several other European countries along with Ukraine are hard at work to build this lasting peace with very specific points including security guarantees uh the territories that belong to Ukraine the issue of reconstruction the economy and critical minerals we&amp;#39;ve been able to go into the details of those proposals the third area of progress which uh really Mark a turning point is the fact that we were able to talk about the details of the security guarantees and the president has shown this over the past few days and he said so a moment ago we want peace he wants peace we want peace peace swiftly but we don&amp;#39;t want an agreement that is weak the fact that there are Europeans that are ready to engage to provide for these security guarantees and now there&amp;#39;s a clear American message that the US as an ally is ready to provide that solidarity for that approach that&amp;#39;s a turning point in my view and that is one of the great areas of progress that we&amp;#39;ve made during this trip and during this discussion when it comes to troops in the past a year ago specifically we saw a reason to talk about sending troops uh to for strategic re regions today when we talk about troops we&amp;#39;re talking about sending them in after we&amp;#39;ve negotiated a lasting peace and once we have that solid lasting peace that&amp;#39;s part of an agreement signed by Ukraine signed by Russia and for which we will provide the guarantees and at that point and recently Fran&amp;#39;s work with the UK to provide its contributions we&amp;#39;ve worked on plans we&amp;#39;ve worked with our militaries not to go to the front lines not to go into occupied territories but as a show of support to show that we have a negotiated piece signed by both sides and that is a piece we will preserve so these would be peaceful deployments of troops not for combat these would be deploy of an assurance Force they would be limited but they show solidarity I have also spoken with all of our allies and there are European and non-european allies who are ready and willing to take part in that effort countries have helped Ukraine maintain its military capabilities in terms of the number of soldiers it has equipment whereas others have provided logistical support on the ground the question is whether or in what form the US will contribute and during our discussions and during the discussions with Russia we&amp;#39;ve understood that this would be acceptable to Russia and that&amp;#39;s a very important area of progress and that means that in this context the Europeans will shoulder their part of the burden their share of the burden we have a strong Alliance that we&amp;#39;ve built over the decades we have our solidarity and we have deterrence capacities what does it mean would it be dangerous if there is an agreement signed by Ukraine and Russia thanks to the efforts of President Trump and if we provide the guarantees and Russia violates the agreement then it would be in conflict with everyone who is engaged in the peace process and that is a change that was something we did not see in the past that&amp;#39;s not what we saw on 2014 so that is the real change that we&amp;#39;re marking we have this deterrence capacity on the American side we have the capacity for engagement on the European side and that&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;re going to continue working on together it&amp;#39;s not dangerous but it&amp;#39;s credible it&amp;#39;s less dangerous than things that could happen in the long term and I think this is what we need to do to ensure security and I say this very clearly we&amp;#39;re also talking about security for Europeans I&amp;#39;ve been saying this for weeks now if we do not guarantee the security of this territory within Europe then how can we guarantee our own security for one and all we live just 1,500 kilm from Ukraine and the Germans and polish are even closer so our collective security is important we need to answer this call for Europeans to be more and Americans will be there still in solidarity Europeans are working for their collective security but I really think this was a turning point today in our discussions Emanuel thank you very much great job and it&amp;#39;s been wonderful being with you and say hello to your beautiful wife and we will see you again soon we&amp;#39;ll be speaking off and we&amp;#39;ll get this thing worked out we&amp;#39;re going to get it done so important and great job thank you [Music] and the joint news conference wraps up there with President Trump and the French President Emanuel macron as they discuss three years in the making of this war in Ukraine president Trump wants to end it and also macron does too but they have different ways they want to go about it president Trump wants an assurance that money will be paid back to the United States while the French President is wanting some assurances from Russia that um Ukraine would be able to keep parts of the land that has been overtaken right now by Russia so we provided that coverage to you right here on live now from Fox without any Interruption bringing it to you from the beginning all the way to the end that&amp;#39;s the way we do it that&amp;#39;s the way we like it here on live now from Fox almost as if you were in the East room there of the White House we&amp;#39;ll take a two-minute break stay right here with us more to come on live now"

      "hasCaptions": true,
      "language": "en",
      "captions": "This just happened at the United Nations. And it certainly is a moment in the whole discussion of where the U.S. is right now. Vis-A-Vis the European allies and Ukraine. There was a resolution that pass at the United Nations marking the three years, three years of the war, and the U.S. did not vote yes. The U.S. voted no. And among the other countries that voted no were North Korea, Russia, Hungary, and Belarus. And the list goes on. And what this resolution said was that Russia invaded Ukraine and also did have language in there that suggested that Russia should leave Ukraine, and it should go back to the borders before Russia invaded. this is really amazing that the U.S. is now on record in the United Nations, on the side of North Korea and Russia when it comes to language. So it&amp;#39;s just a resolution marking it. it doesn&amp;#39;t really do anything in resolution. This is a U.S. drafted resolution that did not identify Russia as the aggressor. That was a separate one that they tried, which didn&amp;#39;t which didn&amp;#39;t, pass. You&amp;#39;re right. There was a separate resolution. But as the language is upgraded, the U.S. says we&amp;#39;re not going to. That&amp;#39;s exactly right. We&amp;#39;re not going to call Russia, which is why they voted no at the U.N. Yeah, but I think when you take that in conjunction with Vance&amp;#39;s remarks at the Munich Security Conference, which is, of course, a very important sort of international event where he really focused on sort of these cultural issues and late into Europe quite strongly, it seems like we&amp;#39;re seeing is a repositioning of the United States away from the nation&amp;#39;s traditional allies in Europe and towards Russia. And it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s remarkable. Yeah. And I think I think that&amp;#39;s totally right. When you look at the big picture in the immediate term, what Trump is trying to do is get a deal is get a deal to end the war, which he did. To be fair, he did campaign on. But the way he&amp;#39;s approaching it is going all in on Russian language, frankly, Russian propaganda. And, it almost reminds me of it, of back after January 6th, where it&amp;#39;s like what you saw, what actually happened didn&amp;#39;t really happen in order to get what he wants. It&amp;#39;s a kind of Jedi mind trick to get you to forget the facts that when we all kind of saw ahead of us, that obviously showed Russia&amp;#39;s aggression leading to this conflict, I think he says right on the big picture, it is a repositioning, but it&amp;#39;s a repositioning in which the Trump administration has sought to do because that kind of transactional nature, if we don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s our friend, who&amp;#39;s our foe, we can change day to day, is what he sees as his negotiating power. But I think with the larger kind of world sees as just kind of Trump&amp;#39;s personality. Right. Like the flattery works the, the, that he may have, turn against others, but he&amp;#39;s been fairly consistent in terms of parroting Russian language, as you&amp;#39;ve said, which has caused alarms, I think even within his own party. The only thing I would add, though, is if I remember back to the electorate and last year there was a big turn against foreign aid, against, investing in Ukraine. And I think even the framing of that as European interests rather than in American interests is one that Donald Trump has seized on to be able to create a wedge between, his kind of portion of the electorate, which I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s just a Maga base, but I think it&amp;#39;s kind of across from a graphic one that has not seen the the biggest, probably. I think that&amp;#39;s a really important point, and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s something that we can lose sight of that, you know, America first, whatever that means. If you, depending on what flavor of it you&amp;#39;re talking about, does have support beyond the base. But the distinction matters about does Ukraine feel like an American interests. Right. Can America first can lead you to invest and support? But that&amp;#39;s not what they&amp;#39;ve done. But is there a way to follow up on those campaign promises? Pull back from Ukraine and not be falling all over himself to parrot Russia? Just listen to what, listen to what Steve Wyckoff said. well, actually, first, let&amp;#39;s assume that Pete Hegseth, followed by Steve Wyckoff, who&amp;#39;s the president&amp;#39;s envoy to the Middle East, but he&amp;#39;s involved in these issues there, say Russia attacked unprovoked into Ukraine three years ago tomorrow. Fair to say, it&amp;#39;s a very complicated situation. The war didn&amp;#39;t need to happen. It was provoked. It doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean it was provoked by the Russians. There were all kinds of conversations back then about Ukraine joining NATO. The president has spoken about this. That didn&amp;#39;t need to happen. That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m talking about, right? It&amp;#39;s giving away the game entirely. and at least it is pretty explicitly. It&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious what&amp;#39;s happening. Some of this, I fear, is about illiteracy on the part of the voters not knowing, for example, about the spending that&amp;#39;s going to Ukraine, that&amp;#39;s actually funding American technology. Right? Funding, American manufacturing plants. And by the time you do learn those facts, it&amp;#39;s too late. But I do think look, not to out us here, Donna, but you and I are both old enough to remember when Mitt Romney got up and said Russia was the central, you know, enemy of the United States. You remember that? You okay, I&amp;#39;m adding everybody at the table. Ryan&amp;#39;s right about it in the history. Yeah. But, and so to see the silence from so many, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress, people who have been such staunch, like foreign policy hawks for so long, who have raised alarms for, about Russia for over a decade, is just unbelievably striking."

      "captions": "all right here we go watching the White House at this hour moments from now president Donald Trump will welcome French president uel macron to talk all things Ukraine and all things Russia so this meeting and we know this it comes after a bruising week last week that pitted Trump against Ukraine&amp;#39;s leader in fact at one point Mr Trump called Mr zilinsky a dictator so let&amp;#39;s go to CBS News National Security contributor Sam vinegrad so before we talk about that meeting Sam I want to turn to some breaking news at the United Nations I just got my hands on right here just moments ago the US presented a draft resolution it&amp;#39;s very brief it&amp;#39;s very short but what sticks out to me Sam is no mention of Russian aggression or a ceasefire in Ukraine so what should we take away from that language well is it unusual day when the United States language for a resolution really mirrors what you&amp;#39;d expect to come more out of the Kremlin the United States has typically aligned itself with other countries at the United Nations who&amp;#39;ve condemned El legal invasions of other countries instead what we have today is a very vanilla resolution that really just says that the United States is mourning the tragic loss of life throughout the Russian Federation Ukraine conflict and this un uh resolution stands in St contrast to efforts by other countries at the UN General Assembly to table and ultimately get past a much stronger resolution condemning Russian activity so the United States is currently in outlier with European countries on the public stage and now in outlier as well at the United Nations based upon the very very water down text of this resolution well and of course so many European nations watching this is a policy shift that raises concerns on so many levels but I want to get back to what&amp;#39;s going on at the white house uh French president Emanuel macron he seems to back Biden era policies relative to Ukraine but this is a new day as you and I have talked about it&amp;#39;s a new Administration not keen on keev what are you watching for today what I&amp;#39;m watching for is whether Emanuel maon has figured out how to convince Donald Trump that not abandoning Ukraine is in US interests we have to remember mall and Trump have a long history this is not 2016 or 2017 this is not their first rodeo they know each other well and that call knows what is top of mind for president Trump he knows what ultimately will get president Trump not to walk away from Key National Security priorities and that is likely why MCL is coming to this meeting armed not just with National Security arguments but also with financial ones maon is expected to table a European security assistance package as well as a promise of European peacekeeping forces to try to convince president Trump that the United States won&amp;#39;t keep shouldering the burden of Ukrainian security all by itself now in reality the Europeans have been stepping up to the plate in a significant way but the US has based upon the size of our economy and other factors shouldered the largest majority of security assistance to Ukraine so I&amp;#39;m watching to see what that security assistance package looks like and I&amp;#39;m watching to see whether mcconell has figured out how to make a convincing argument to president Trump well I&amp;#39;ve also got to ask you about something that seems to be a change from last week so the US wanting a play at Ukraine&amp;#39;s minerals to recoup costs uh last week zalinsky even weeks before that signal no but this week we&amp;#39;re hearing there are some negotiations on that front zalinski and his cabinet are very aware of what it will take to keep the United States not just at the negotiating table but in the fight and it is very clear across the board not just in Ukraine that President Trump Trump does not view defense of other countries as a free tab instead he Associates significant cost with that discussion so we should expect zalinsky to continue negotiating with Secretary of the Treasury bent on access to critical minerals and again we should expect European countries to very vocally describe the financial assistance they&amp;#39;ll provide to Ukraine so that President Trump can walk away from these discussions saying that he got money back from America and that us expenditures on Ukraine will decline over the longer term Trump is looking for a financial bottom line coming out of discussions with mcal with prime minister Kier Stormer on Thursday and of course discussions with ukrainians themselves so far we have not heard of any deals Financial deals that he&amp;#39;s doing with Russia but we should note that his delegation to rad last week did discuss normalizing ties between the United States and Russia which would allow the lifting of sanctions against Russia that would pave the way for business to really resume between our two countries as well as more significant trade so many pieces on the game board in a big day in Washington DC with that meeting between the two presidents Sam we know you&amp;#39;ll be all over it covering it Sterling as always thank you so much good to talk to you on a Monday"

I&amp;#39;m wondering if you believe that this critical minerals deal with Ukraine represents a de facto security guarantee by the United States since the us would have an interest in protecting those reserves in Ukraine thank you we&amp;#39;re on time with the tariffs and it seems like that&amp;#39;s moving along very rapidly we&amp;#39;ve been mistreated very badly by many countries not just Canada and Mexico uh we&amp;#39;ve been taken advantage of we were led by in some cases fools because anybody that would sign documents like they signed where they were able to take advantage of the American people like has happened over the last long period of time except for a little four-year period that uh took place four years ago uh but uh anybody that would agree to allow this to happen to our country uh should be ashamed of themselves now the the tariffs are going forward on time on schedule uh this is uh an abuse that took place for many many years and I&amp;#39;m not even blaming the other countries that did this I I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen I mean you know who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States took advantage of the United States on uh on manufacturing on just about everything every aspect that you could imagine they took advantage of I look at some of these agreements I&amp;#39;d read them at night and I&amp;#39;d say who would ever sign a thing like this so the terrorists will go forward yes and we&amp;#39;re going to make up a lot of territory we&amp;#39;re going to all we want is reciprocal we want reciprocity we want to have uh the same so if somebody charges us we charge them it&amp;#39;s very simple but uh it&amp;#39;ll be very good for our country our country will be extremely uh liquid and Rich again plus we&amp;#39;re doing other things as you know we find tremendous waste Fraud and Abuse at levels that nobody thought possible you&amp;#39;re seeing what&amp;#39;s going on and uh that was also part of the Harvard poll do you agree with what president Trump is doing with Elon and others that are looking for the waste frud and abuse and uh the numbers were staggering it was like uh 70% to 2% everybody wants to find out they don&amp;#39;t like it and you know the radical left or whoever it may be start screaming about the Constitution but it has nothing to do with the Constitution it has to do with fairness to this country it has to do with being ripped off and when you read the things that all of these billions and and I mean many billions hundreds of billions of dollars has have been spent on that&amp;#39;s all you have to do is stand up here and read them I could stand up all day and read the kind of things where we&amp;#39;re spending all of this money the good news is that uh when you think of how rich a nation we can be when we get rid of this you know sometimes you&amp;#39;ll buy a company and you&amp;#39;ll see it was really really well-run it&amp;#39;s they accounted for every penny well not much you can do there you got yourself a bad deal this one is the exact opposite tremendous fraud tremendous waste and and when you think of what it is you know Elon uses an expression caring if we had people that cared just cared a little bit when they did contracts when they negotiated with outside vendors for on behalf of the United States that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m doing now I&amp;#39;m negotiating for the people of the United States so we&amp;#39;re doing a great job of it I will say we found uh it&amp;#39;ll be hundreds of billions of dollars of of waste and Fraud and Abuse thank you please uh Luke I think this discussion is a very important one okay that&amp;#39;s president Trump there and the French President as you see at the White House discussing their bilateral uh today most of it centered as you heard there on the war in Ukraine and the president&amp;#39;s desire as he said uh to end that saying we&amp;#39;ve had great discussions on ending that war our focuses on achieving a ceasefire he said as soon as possible ultimately he hopes a permanent peace described the meeting with uh Mr macron another step towards ending that war and that macron uh agrees that this is the right time and may be the only time in fact to end that war I&amp;#39;m going to bring in Aman Javers who&amp;#39;s been listening to this as well and aan you did hear at the end uh as well a comment on tariffs which the president said quote relating to Mexico and and Canada of course the tariffs are going forward on time and on schedule yeah so it appears that the president didn&amp;#39;t get a deal that he likes with Mexico and Canada in order to further delay those tariffs so he says we&amp;#39;re still on track there and just an extraordinarily Dynamic and delicate moment here in this negotiation over the future of Ukraine as the United States has sort of thrust itself in as the dealmaker here as you heard the president there say I&amp;#39;m a dealmaker that&amp;#39;s what I do uh and yet the terms of this potential negotiation are so wide open as we sit here right now uh whether or not the Russians will pay for any damages done whether the Russians will give up territory whether the ukrainians will have to reimburse the United States in some way as president Trump wants for the investment the United States has made in Ukraine whether that&amp;#39;s through minerals or in some other way what the role of the Europeans will be in this ultimate deal all of that sort of wide open in a free-for-all negotiation at the moment and you can see macron and Trump here both uh very much at pains to emphasize their Common Ground even as there are just enormous Gulfs in difference in their approach to uh this war mcon saying several times during uh this event and a previous event in the Oval Office that Russia was the aggressor uh in the war in Ukraine that&amp;#39;s something that Donald Trump uh does not like to acknowledge uh but mcon making at pains to say that in front of Donald Trump here uh and Trump uh for his part you know insisting that Ukraine has to pay the United States back for some of the investment that the United States has made and saying that the Biden Administration made a terrible deal by giving open-ended defense Aid to the ukrainians without guarantees of any kind of payment or loans or uh resources in exchange for that so A fascinating wideopen multi-dimensional negotiation rolling out right in front of us here Scott yeah and we&amp;#39;ll continue to monitor it aan thanks very much for that you&amp;#39;ll let us know what else we might need to know from those two gentlemen at the White House today am and Javers thank you"

      "hasCaptions": true,
      "language": "en",
      "captions": "The Doge led effort to drastical the government workforce is really impacting Veterans Affairs employees just last week. More than a thousand workers the who did not take the deferred re package were fired. Many were probationary employees who had served less than 1 to 2 years in the department. They had fewer job protections. They didn&amp;#39;t have the right to ap Workers who were allegedly underperformi also targeted the Trump administration, claimi the move would save the departme more than $98 million a year. Andrew Lennox is a marine vetera who spent ten years serving. He was fired from the supervisor training program at the VA medical center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Andrew, thank you so much for being with first off, I just want to understand someth because the grounds for terminat in your case, in so many others, is basically a question of whether your continued employ was in the public interest. What is your reaction to that? So yeah, that&amp;#39;s the exact language that was on the termination, notification. it&amp;#39;s my in my reaction. At first it was surprise, your d And I mean, this morning as I packed up my office, it&amp;#39;s a you know, because it&amp;#39;s, you know I was terminated for my performa I haven&amp;#39;t even had a performance Nobody consulted any, you know, any supervisors or the director of our hospital before making these terminations So tell me about your job and why you wanted to work at th Yeah. So I spent ten years in the Mari I love the greatest job I ever h And I made the decision. Transition into, the civilian wo And for a little bit, I. I worked in civilian jobs. I was at a pharmaceutical compan for a little bit, and they sent me to a military friendly employers conference, and I ended up sharing a table with some Veterans Affairs social workers. There&amp;#39;s a a marine Corps vet, and he was telling me about the  he does and like looking at that group of people and the organizations to get bac to, you know, veterans. I made the decision that is what I want to do. I want to continue serving my co And I thought there&amp;#39;d be no bett than helping, you know, veterans you know, my family, the people you know, that, you know, gave me so much I&amp;#39;d like to get back in my role. There&amp;#39;s an administrative office primary care, department of the hospital. So it&amp;#39;s a lot of behind the scen It&amp;#39;s kind of eliminating the red and friction that just comes into health care As far as, like, scheduling doctors, the patients making sure wait times are short, they, you know, scheduling, vacation pay, ordering equipment all these things that we try and take the administrative burd off of the doctors and the nurses and the care providers to get veterans treated well, as quickly and effectively as po Yeah. So you have the VA secretary, Doug Collins, saying that these firings will not negatively impact VA health care. What&amp;#39;s your reaction to that? you didn&amp;#39;t ask my supervisor tha he didn&amp;#39;t give me time to do a proper transition of dut to people that would be covering down on what I was supposed to do. we didn&amp;#39;t get to pass my access to different, you know, networks and databases I had no time to make sure that I left the job you know, with the proper transi So there wasn&amp;#39;t a gap in treatment or service. I had to come in after I was fir to make sure that my team had all of the information until they cut my access to my, government email and phone at 5  Friday evening. Do you get you know, I think a lot of people don&amp;#39;t real that almost a third of the federal workforce is, veterans. Do you get the impression as you you know, just people, Americans talking about federal workers, politicians talking about federal workers, that there&amp;#39;s an understanding of who federal workers are? Yeah. I think it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s ki it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s grown as far as like the evil bureaucracy, you know, the words that are being thrown  or you know, parasitic, lazy, unproductive, and like, we&amp;#39;re hearing these wo But again, I had limited experience with, the VA before I worked there. And then seeing the men and wome that are dedicating their lives, they&amp;#39;re not making the most mone doing this. They&amp;#39;re doing it for different r especially our our doctors. Our administrators is highly tra highly skilled people that made this decision to serve like these are the parasites. These are the lazy, unproductive you know, employees that you&amp;#39;re  You know, politics and other media outlets say there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s combat veter there is survivors. You know, who whose family members passed away You know, in service of this cou it&amp;#39;s your neighbors. These these are not the evil bur You think that are just going up the system and living off the system. We want to work hard. We want to help people. And it&amp;#39;s for, you know, it&amp;#39;s across the board for all federal agencies. But it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s easy to paint as an enemy in this situation. Andrew, thank you so much for your service in the Marine Corps. Thank you for your service at th We really appreciate your time t Yeah, I appreciate it, too. And I you know, I just like to say a lot of the times the word layoff is being thrown around for what&amp;#39;s happening. I want to be clear. These are these are terminations we&amp;#39;ve been denied, the protections that most people get during reductions in force. And we were terminated due to a technicality that they found a loophole in. It&amp;#39;s, you know, my belief that it&amp;#39;s a matter of time until they find more loopholes to deny more people their benefi And, you know, the services that we enjoy from the federal government that it is a concern broadly held by people, even still, who are employed in the federal workforce. I&amp;#39;ve been hearing it. Andrew, again, thank you so much We really do appreciate it."

      "captions": "to direct the day-to-day functioning of the agency responsible for preventing and investigating Terror attacks responding to mass shootings investigating International drug cartels and gangs forting cyber attacks and arresting violent criminals and investigating public corruption among other things Donald Trump has tapped a podcaster and right-wing media personality who once said this quote my entire life right now is owning the lives that person is named Dan Bonino he will be the deputy director of the FBI the number two at the country&amp;#39;s top law enforcement agency it is a job that does not require Senate confirmation not that Republicans have had any objection to any of Trump&amp;#39;s picks anyway but if you&amp;#39;re not familiar with bun Gino here&amp;#39;s a small sampling of the things he&amp;#39;s had to say over the years Trump is an apex predator he&amp;#39;s The Lion King Trump went out there tonight and did what Trump does he&amp;#39;s the shark in the ocean and he acted like it he lost no one from his base no one shame on us if we don&amp;#39;t enter the legal profession and start to pull people out of the doj I have no problem with Donald Trump investigating Jack Smith either and you shouldn&amp;#39;t either Jack Smith doesn&amp;#39;t have a pardon what happened yesterday with President Trump and the targeting of him and his attorneys by this piece of human scum all of these people targeting him in the Justice Department that have forfeited any semblance of Allegiance and Fidelity to the constitutional republic I do not need power drunk pseudo monarchs little mini tyrants in my supposedly conservative County though sending out ridiculous childlike Amateur hour eatings demanding people wear masks and situations where the risk of transmission is somewhat close to zero you can take your mask mandate and shove it right up your the karate man I never thought it I never thought I&amp;#39;d have to use it in real life but gu my reminds me of like the house remember guess who&amp;#39;s back by house haraldo is back he wants to fight me again why does this guy always want to fight me why does everybody always want to fight danino why why does everybody want to fight me all the time do I have a punchable face or something H the conspiracy varies the out out rage the tightness of the t-shirts all of it surely floats Donald Trump&amp;#39;s boat and his music to his ears it&amp;#39;s likely part of the very essence of the reason he was selected but the job of deputy director of the FBI the United States of America is a serious job that affects every person living here people around the world it&amp;#39;s the kind of job that has to be done well by whoever does it if the bureau stands any chance of actually catching real bad guys as the Washington Post reports quote the deputy director answers to the director serving as the agency&amp;#39;s second in command responsible for day-to-day law enforcement operations and all of the FBI&amp;#39;s domestic and international investigative and intelligence activities the FBI has 55 field offices 60 offices abroad 38,000 staff staffers in a budget of10 billion doll managing the day-to-day Affairs of the FBI is a serious responsibility and traditionally that post of deputy director of the FBI has gone to a career FBI agent in fact the FBI agents Association says that in a meeting in January before cash Patel was confirmed they told Patel this quote the FBI deputy director should continue to be an onboard active special agent as has been the case for 117 years for many compelling reasons including operational expertise and experience as well as the trust of our special agent population according to the FBI agents Association at the time cash Patel agreed and said that the job should go to a career FBI agent now fatal either changed his mind or was overruled but he&amp;#39;s given an already wary Workforce and other reason to be suspicious and distrustful of him and the FBI now has at its Helm what the New York Times describes this way quote the least experienced leadership pair in the bureau&amp;#39;s history Donald Trump&amp;#39;s choice of a prot trump po ER to be the number two at the FBI is where we start today NBC News justice reporter author of sedition Hunters how January 6 broke the justice system Ryan R&amp;#39;s back plus former lead investigator for the January 6 select committee author of harbingers what January 6 in Charlottesville reveal about Rising threats to American democracy Tim ha&amp;#39;s back also joining us former top official the Department of Justice MSNBC legal analyst Andrew weissman&amp;#39;s here Ryan Riley you have some great reporting on how this is being received inside the FBI tell us about it yeah I think a lot of eye roll sort of within the FBI but remember there is a contingent within the FBI who is very supportive of Donald Trump and some of the moves that he is making um but when you know Dan Bonino was was announced the what my brain immediately went to was actually an interaction that he had with a former uh FBI uh special agent who&amp;#39;s also now a podcast a podcaster Kyle Surf and he&amp;#39;s someone who is in very close uh communication with with cash pel cash Patel&amp;#39;s Foundation before cash pel was FBI director actually had paid Kyle serin&amp;#39;s family along with a couple of other individ right-wing uh FBI special agents and there was this this falling out um because uh there&amp;#39;s just disagreement about how uh this maral Lago raid was being discussed because Dan banino accepted this sort of premise that there was something untour about the maralago uh search that the FBI had had messed up there um and Kyle sarapin looked at those those documents and and said that no this is actually really standard operating procedure so there was this enormous falling out even though basically Dan bino was the reason that Kyle sarapin got onto the radar of cash Patel and received that money that&amp;#39;s where he did his first interview for example when he was Kyle sarapin was still this FBI whistleblower there was this falling out over just basic facts um because you know Kyle for everything about him he&amp;#39;s someone who is very much so about you know establishing the facts and the facts were is that this was standard operation procedure how that search was conducted the FBI did not have a plot to assassinate uh Donald Trump when they searched marago When Donald Trump was all the way in New Jersey so you know you very quickly see this sort of breaking out into a different realm where you know you have a deputy director of the FBI now who just doesn&amp;#39;t seem very dedicated to the facts based on what you just presented there and based upon a lot of the rhetoric that we&amp;#39;ve seen uh previously of course I should say Dan bin know is you know in his in his uh in his first appearance I guess today or last show today uh was saying that he&amp;#39;s now taking on a different role but within the bureau there&amp;#39;s just you know this comes on top of just so much in the past month plus that has really just rocked the bureau to its core um this isn&amp;#39;t going to help that entire situation Nicole Andrew Weisman um NBC is reporting this um quote this is really concerning any hope that cash could be steered by having experienced leaders around him is out the window we now have two conspiracy theorists and election deniers running our Premier law enforcement an intelligence agency that is beyond problematic I think that some of what is is public facing right is is investigating crimes that go on to be prosecuted but some of what I I think is opaque to the vast majority of Americans is that the FBI is a massive intelligence at National Security Agency and National Security cases are not cases that are always um tried in a courtroom sometimes No One Ever Knows the details but cash Vel and Dan Bon will also be in charge of of of that how will that work well um I think the idea that you have two people with a grand total of zero zero experience working at the FBI is it&amp;#39;s not just problematic that is um it makes you question whether the goal here is to not have an effective FBI at all um to basically be hollowing it out um from as when you think about what those leaders have to do one is they have to inspire people they have to give confidence these are public servants who give up a lot and you have to sort of make sure that they feel um supported and that you know they are um rewarded for doing a good job but you also need people who can spot key issues um who can guide them approp ately and if they don&amp;#39;t have experience at the bureau neither one of them I I pray that they learn on the job quickly but that is not what you want in this group and particularly in the National Security area area um I remember director Mueller who I was the general counsel for um I was a privilege to serve with him I mean you could feel every day that he and the deputy director what weighed on them was the idea that that there would be some terrorist incident here or abroad where people would be hurt um and the that is such um it&amp;#39;s important to have that work ethic but it&amp;#39;s important to have that depth of experience to know where to look and what is noise and what is real um and that to me was the thing that I found remarkable in watching those two men as well as Andrew C and a host of other people and the idea that you would pick people who don&amp;#39;t have that skill set and hope that they get that skill set on the job is beyond it&amp;#39;s just beyond imaginable in terms of just from an apolitical perspective what you want in terms of making this country safe"

this is all part of a plan to thin out FBI offices in the capital region so let&amp;#39;s bring in CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland to help us break all of this down welcome Scott I want to talk about the new deputy director you&amp;#39;ve been around Bonino what can you tell us about him and what should we expect of him in this new role Dan Bonino among other things is wildly famous on the talk radio circuit and in conservative circles he has an audience that is measured in millions and he is taking a civil service job to a degree becoming the deputy director of the FBI on his program late this morning he confirmed he&amp;#39;s taking the job in the name of public service and that it&amp;#39;s hard to walk away from a popular show Dan Bonino among other things was the successor to the late Rush limbo inheriting that show and holding it for years but there are any number of concerns inside the FBI and among critics of the Trump Administration about putting somebody with no FBI experience into the number two position at the bureau because the number two person at the bureau does all that blocking and tackling administering of the agency

politics in America that is quite a stance for somebody who&amp;#39;s going to be running a law enforcement agency okay Scott let&amp;#39;s talk about cash Patel&amp;#39;s first full week as director of the FBI he said he is moving more than a thousand FBI agents to other Outpost so what are officials saying about this and have they expressed any concern so far it&amp;#39;s a big shift let&amp;#39;s start off with the fact that over the weekend he&amp;#39;s announced about a thousand DC based lead leaders Executives and agents are going to be redirected or reassigned elsewhere in the country there are about five dozen FBI field offices around America and he&amp;#39;s going to decentralize the agency move these agents and employees around that could cause some turnover it also may be a politically popular move in some circles to have less people in Washington and more people out in America but there&amp;#39;s also that ticking Time Bomb inside the FBI the list that was compiled under Department of Justice orders of 5,000 or so agents and employees es who were part of the January 6th investigation many of those agents are worried about or resigned to some type of retaliation for following orders and investigating a violent attack on the capital that list could make its way to cash Patel&amp;#39;s desk and there are so many people inside the agency right now worried the email is going to arrive any minute that they&amp;#39;re being disciplined or fired or forced to resign that&amp;#39;s a difficult condition for law enforcement to operate under yeah very difficult for these people to do their jobs so we know Batel is also tapped to run the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms or the ATF can we expect to see a similar shakeup here just like we&amp;#39;ve seen with the FBI I think no matter who is going to run the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms there were going to be some big changes in fact the last director in the Biden Administration predicted to CBS News there would be Cuts there would be shakeups because there&amp;#39;s a Republican party mandate to chop or redirect the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms conservatives argue that that agency is an encroachment on the Second Amendment supporters of the agency say it helps reduce gun crimes and mass shootings in America the new leadership will likely mean a refocusing of their resources but there&amp;#39;s a bigger threat outside the administration to the ATF the Republican Congress seems keen on lowering the budget shrinking Appropriations for the ATF making it more difficult for them to do anything okay I want to ask you about the hearing happening today today on the associated press&amp;#39;s fight to restore their access to presidential

      "captions": "a federal judge will hear arguments this afternoon in a potentially precedent setting lawsuit filed by the Associated Press against the White House over access to the west wing and it&amp;#39;s lawsuit filed Friday in Washington&amp;#39;s US District Court the AP accuses white house chief of staff Susan Wilds Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor bwitch and press secretary Caroline lovit of Legally restricting its reporters from White House events B claims the Restriction is retaliation for the news organization re refusing to revise its IND indry respected style guide to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America the White House called the suit quote nothing more than a blatant PR stun masquerading as a First Amendment case end quote dozens of news outlets including CBS News have signed on to a letter from the White House correspondence Association calling for the ban to be lifted CBS News legal contributor and loyal La law school Professor Jessica levenson joins us now Jessica good to see you what kind of case does the AP have here oh they they have a decent case what they&amp;#39;re arguing here is that they&amp;#39;ve been targeted based on what they will and won&amp;#39;t say and when it comes to the First Amendment what I tell my students the very first day is we&amp;#39;re worried about the type of censorship where the government picks winners and losers based on I don&amp;#39;t like what you&amp;#39;re saying or I don&amp;#39;t like your Viewpoint or I don&amp;#39;t like who you are and that&amp;#39;s what the AP is arguing here that because they won&amp;#39;t say Gulf of America that they&amp;#39;re being denied access that they were previously granted but the White House is essentially saying we&amp;#39;re not Banning you from all events we&amp;#39;re just not giving you unfettered access to the President right well that&amp;#39;s exactly right and I think they&amp;#39;re filing uses the term extra special access that the AP has always obtained not just normal access but extra special access and that they can still do their job without that access and that&amp;#39;s part of what their filing argued here but in terms of the legality I think the question won&amp;#39;t be what type of access the AP now has but why it was downgraded in the sense that if you open up a Town Square to people and then you tell only certain people that they have to leave the Town Square because you don&amp;#39;t like what they will or won&amp;#39;t say you weren&amp;#39;t necessarily forced to open up that place to begin with but once you grant access to a group of people then don&amp;#39;t shove some people out because you don&amp;#39;t like again what they say what they won&amp;#39;t say or who they are so other than the argument I just mentioned how else is the administration going to try and justify its action so I think the administration will continue to say really this is a matter of administrative Grace that there is no constitutional right that says You must be allowed in every White House Event or in every time that there is a plane trip every time that there&amp;#39;s an oval office event and that they have to make discretionary decisions all the time and they&amp;#39;ve made a decision here again I think the comment will be but we or excuse me the response will be but why did you make that decision and that&amp;#39;s where this judge will really look at whether or not this decision flies in the face of the First Amendment and the AP is also making a due process argument saying they didn&amp;#39;t obtain any notice or opportunity to be heard the AP says the president&amp;#39;s order only carries Authority within the US Mexico other International bodies they don&amp;#39;t have to recognize the name change is that solid reasoning from a legal standpoint so I think it is it is part of this case and part of what the a is arguing here is that they have an international audience and part of their standards are based on using terms and phrases that would be recognizable to an international audience so what they&amp;#39;re saying is yes the president has power within the territory to change names for instance by executive order you know barring some other sort of threshold but that when it comes to this situation we&amp;#39;re talking about an international place and we&amp;#39;re talking about a situation again where the AP standard say we use the terms that an international audience would recognize okay Jessica lenson thank you"

We were together, we did it together. And I think a lot of progress has been made. We&amp;#39;ve had some very good talks with Russia. We&amp;#39;ve had some very good talks with others, and we&amp;#39;re trying to get the war ended with Russia and Ukraine, and I think we&amp;#39;ve come a long way in a short period of weeks. And the president&amp;#39;s been very helpful also. And we&amp;#39;re also talking about trade, various trade deals that we will be doing with France and uh We&amp;#39;ll be discussing a little bit further, then we&amp;#39;ll have a press conference later on. You can ask some questions. We&amp;#39;ll be having a press conference in a little while. We&amp;#39;re gonna have lunch. With the entire French staff, and we look forward to it, and again, the relationship&amp;#39;s been very special with France and very special with this gentleman on my right. And we look forward to keeping that going for a long period of time. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. I want to thank Mr. President for his hospitality. We had a good discussion this morning for the G7 here and for the 3. Yeah of of this war. in Ukraine and I think uh I&amp;#39;ll come on objective theory is to build peace and uh and a solid and long standing peace. Uh, and this is what we will discuss obviously because uh uh I have great respect for. bravery and the resistance of Ukrainian people. And uh we do share the objective of peace, but we are very aware of the necessity to uh We have guarantees and solid peace in order to, to stabilize the situation. I, I&amp;#39;m here as a friend because um. Through centuries we&amp;#39;ve been friends and we are, we are personal friends as you mentioned it because we worked very well together. And, and I think um the US and France always stand on the same side, the right side, I would say of. And this is exactly what&amp;#39;s at stake today and this is a very important moment for Europe as well and uh I&amp;#39;m here as well after discussions with all my colleagues. To say that Europe is willing to step up. To be a a stronger partner. To do more in defense and security for the continent and as well to be a a reliable. Uh, partner and to be engaged and trade economy, investment in a lot of topics, so I&amp;#39;m very excited by the discussion we will have and obviously we will follow. And I want to thank you again, Mr. President, for your presence for Notre Dame de Paris a lot for French people, and I, I want to thank you for that. That&amp;#39;s the cathedral, and they&amp;#39;ve done a fantastic job. The president&amp;#39;s done a great job in bringing it back. That was a terrible thing, like what, 5 years ago watching that burn was a very uh Horrible, horrible sight, and you&amp;#39;ve done a fantastic job in bringing it back, so I congratulate you. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Anybody, uh, want to ask a question or two? Is that a foolish question. Thank you, Mr. President. the critical mineral. It looks like we&amp;#39;re getting very close. The deal is being worked on where I think getting very close to getting an agreement where Where we get our money back over a period of time, but it also gives us something where I think it&amp;#39;s very beneficial to their economy, to to them as a country. But you know, we&amp;#39;re in for $350 billion how we got there, I don&amp;#39;t know, but that&amp;#39;s a lot of money, a lot of, a lot of money invested and we had nothing. Nothing to show for it. It was the Biden administration&amp;#39;s fault. Uh, the, uh, Europeans are in for about $100 billion and they do it as a form in the form of a loan, and the Europeans have been great on this issue. They understood it wasn&amp;#39;t fair, and we were able to work something out, but with the Ukrainians, I think I can say that we&amp;#39;re Very close Scots around here someplace. And I think we can say that we&amp;#39;re very high. I think uh. We&amp;#39;re very close. Do you have something to say about that, Scott? We, we are very close. Good. Good. One yard one. All right, good. What? What a field include a security guarantee for Ukraine. Well, it&amp;#39;ll be Europe is going to make sure that nothing happens. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to be much of a problem. I think once we settle, uh, there&amp;#39;s gonna be no more war in Ukraine, and you&amp;#39;re not going to have a it&amp;#39;s not going to be a very big problem. That&amp;#39;s going to be the least of it. We&amp;#39;re hearing from some Greek media reporting that the US has agreed to shut down a military base in Greece that&amp;#39;s been a logistical hub for NATO. And who shut down? Uh, that the US has agreed to shut it down at the request of Turkey and Russia. Is that all true? Marco, do you have anything to say about that? that&amp;#39;s a no, that&amp;#39;s enough. Uh, Mr. President, it&amp;#39;s a no, sir. It&amp;#39;s not a correct spelling. Thank you, Mr. President, how do you react to uh people in Europe who say that you are abandoning Ukraine and then you&amp;#39;re going to sacrifice the security of Ukraine by making a deal with Vladimir Putin. Now we&amp;#39;re helping Ukraine like nobody&amp;#39;s ever helped Ukraine before, and I can say this if I didn&amp;#39;t become president, Ukraine would write. Now still be at a level where there would be no even thinking about a piece. And it was, uh, it&amp;#39;s a, it&amp;#39;s a sad thing that this happened. This would have never happened, this war if I were president. 0 chance. And it has happened, so. Uh by function is to get you out of the war, get them out of the war, let them live. It&amp;#39;s a bloody war, it&amp;#39;s a horrible war. Thousands of people have been killed a week. And I would say Russia maybe 700,000 people. I think Ukraine probably a similar number, and that&amp;#39;s not talking about the towns and the cities that have been blown up. That&amp;#39;s talking about soldiers. This has been a horrible, bloody mess. And we&amp;#39;re going to get it solved. We&amp;#39;ve got to get it solved. And you know, we&amp;#39;re not talking about America&amp;#39;s soldiers, soldiers from this country, we&amp;#39;re talking about Russia and Ukraine. But on a humanitarian basis we have to get this. Very, very bloody savage problem solved, and I, I will say this also, it could lead to World War 3 if it&amp;#39;s not solved. They&amp;#39;ll be a point at which it&amp;#39;s not going to stop at those two. Countries already there&amp;#39;s such involvement from other countries and uh it could really lead to a very big war, World War 3, and we&amp;#39;re not gonna let that happen either. Would you support the idea to send European troops in Ukraine to back the ceasefire troops may go into Ukraine as peacemakers. Uh, so when the agreement is done, they can watch that everything&amp;#39;s followed properly. I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s going to be a problem, and a lot of the European countries, I think I, I don&amp;#39;t want to speak for France, but I know that the president&amp;#39;s talked about doing that also. I think that&amp;#39;ll be a very good day when we can go in as peacekeepers as opposed to what&amp;#39;s going on right now with everybody being killed, so those troops going into Ukraine, but they have US backing from US troops. Well, we&amp;#39;re gonna have a backing of some kind and uh obviously the European countries are going to be involved and uh I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re going to need much backing. I think that&amp;#39;s not going to be a problem. Once an agreement is signed, Russia is going to get back to its business and Ukraine and Europe are going to get back to their business. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s going to be a problem. What? I will be meeting with President Zelensky. In fact, he may come in this week or next week to sign the agreement. And which would be nice. I&amp;#39;d I&amp;#39;d love to meet him. We meet at the Oval Office. So the agreement&amp;#39;s being worked on now, uh, they&amp;#39;re very close to a final deal. It will be a deal with rare earths and various other things and uh he would like to come, as I understand it here to sign it, and that would be great with me. I think they didn&amp;#39;t have to get it approved by their counsel or whoever might approve it, but I&amp;#39;m sure that will happen back home. Meeting with President Putin also I don&amp;#39;t know when we speak, we&amp;#39;re trying to get this thing worked out, but, uh, yeah, at some point I&amp;#39;ll be meeting with President Putin too. So I can say a few words in French. No. Because. Uh. On the. Uh, uh, the, the pickings. And that. So. So. They don&amp;#39;t. spoken about this this just a moment ago. This is exactly what we want to do. We want to build peace with Ukraine as President Trump mentioned, there are already 1 million dead and wounded in Ukraine since the war began. We had a ceasefire in the past that was not respected. This was under the Minsk agreements 1 and 2. President Trump, as he said, will be meeting with President Zelinsky to sign a deal on rare earths, and we are pleased to see this very strong American involvement. Europe, of course, also stands ready to support Ukraine in various ways, supporting its military and we don&amp;#39;t want to preempt any sort of discussions that are currently underway, but we do share share the same objective of building this lasting peace. I just want to tell you a little story so we&amp;#39;re at the Eiffel Tower having dinner with your wonderful wife and with my wonderful wife and we came out and he started speaking the French deal. And we didn&amp;#39;t have an interpreter and he was going on and on and on, and I was just nodding, yes, yes, yes, and he really sold me out because I got back the next day and I read the papers. I said that&amp;#39;s not what we said He&amp;#39;s a smart customer, I will tell you that. Is a dictator, would you use the same words regarding Putin. Uh I don&amp;#39;t use those words lightly. I think that we&amp;#39;re going to see how it all works out. Let&amp;#39;s see what happens. I think we have a chance of a really good settlement between various countries and you know you&amp;#39;re talking about Europe and you&amp;#39;re talking about Ukraine as part of that whole situation, uh. The other side has a lot of A lot of support also. So let&amp;#39;s see how it all works out. It might work out, look, you can never make up lives. The one thing you can&amp;#39;t, you can make up the money, but you can&amp;#39;t make up the lives. A lot of lives lost, I think probably a lot more lives than people are talking about. It&amp;#39;s been a, it&amp;#39;s been a rough war, but I think we&amp;#39;re close to getting it solved. What&amp;#39;s that? Do you think that Doge could benefit from more streamlined communications. There was that email, uh, telling employees to give 5 things that they&amp;#39;ve done last week, agency heads then told people to ignore it, but Ens about the last e-mail that was sent. Where he wanted to know what you did this week. You know why he wanted that, by the way. I thought it was great because we have people that don&amp;#39;t show up to work and nobody even knows if they work for the government. So by asking the question, tell us what you did this week, what he&amp;#39;s doing is saying, are you actually working? And then if you don&amp;#39;t answer like you&amp;#39;re sort of semi-fired or you&amp;#39;re fired. Because a lot of people are not answering because they don&amp;#39;t even exist. They&amp;#39;re trying to find that&amp;#39;s how badly various parts of our government were run by and especially by this last group. So what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying to find out who&amp;#39;s working for the government, are we paying other people that aren&amp;#39;t working and you know, where&amp;#39;s all that, where&amp;#39;s the money going? We have found Hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far. And we&amp;#39;ve just started. We&amp;#39;re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, cause maybe somebody stole the gold, tons of gold. So I think it was actually there was a lot of genius in sending it. We&amp;#39;re trying to find out if people are working. And so we&amp;#39;re sending a letter to people, please tell us what you did last week. If people don&amp;#39;t respond, it&amp;#39;s very possible that there is no such person or they&amp;#39;re not working. Some of the agency heads instructed their employees not to respond because they&amp;#39;re waiting on further guidance, but Elon Musk&amp;#39;s tweet said Failure to respond would be taken as a resignation, so there&amp;#39;s been a disconnect in in communications. Are you concerned at all about that, no, no, no. That was done in a friendly manner. Only things such as uh perhaps Marco at State Department where they have a very confidential things or the FBI where they&amp;#39;re working on confidential things, uh, and they don&amp;#39;t mean that in any way combatively with Elon, they&amp;#39;re just saying there are some people that you don&amp;#39;t want to really have them tell you what they&amp;#39;re working on last week. Uh, but other than that, uh, I think everyone thought it was a pretty ingenious idea. We have to find out where these people are. Who are they? And we said, if you don&amp;#39;t respond, we assume. You&amp;#39;re not around. And that holds, that stands. And you&amp;#39;re not getting paid anymore too, so, you know, we, we&amp;#39;re doing a real job and we just had a poll come out, I guess the Harvard poll. Saying that it&amp;#39;s massively popular what we&amp;#39;re doing, so. Mr. President, do you still believe in NATO in the alliance between Europe and America in NATO. NATO in June? Very much involved in this. When I first got elected at the very beginning, first term. Uh, I got hundreds of billions of dollars put into NATO. NATO had no money because they hadn&amp;#39;t paid for years and I said, look, if you don&amp;#39;t pay, we&amp;#39;re not going to be a part of NATO. We&amp;#39;re not going to protect. We&amp;#39;re not going to do what we&amp;#39;re supposed to do, and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars into NATO. No, NATO&amp;#39;s a good thing if it&amp;#39;s done properly and if it&amp;#39;s used properly. Is the president in these days he used to uh this lay new speaker a lot, a lot about the tariffs in Canada, in Mexico. And uh I want to know if what is your idea about even if you want to make the same thing what? Can you talk up a little louder? in this uh in this, can you talk a little louder? You have a beautiful voice, but you&amp;#39;re not where are you from? From Italy. Oh, I love Italy. Go ahead, uh, I want to make, uh, I want to know if you have the same idea with Italy about. Well, look, I love Italy and Italy is a very important nation. We have a wonderful woman as your leader. And she was on the conversation today, one that we had the G7. And uh no, I think Italy is doing very well. I think, I think Italy&amp;#39;s got very strong leadership with Georgia. you Uh, any other questions over here? Yes, ma&amp;#39;am you clarify what you meant in your truth today on the major economic development transactions between the US and Russia with respect to what Russia? Uh, so you said there would be major economic development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia. Yes, we&amp;#39;re trying to do some. Economic development deals they have a lot of things that we want. And we&amp;#39;ll see. I mean, I don&amp;#39;t know if that will come to fruition, but we&amp;#39;d love to be able to do that if we could, you know, they have massive, uh, rare earth. It&amp;#39;s a very large, it&amp;#39;s actually the largest in terms of land, it&amp;#39;s by far the largest country, and they have a very valuable things that we could use, and we have things that they could use and it would be very good if we could do that. I think it would be a very good thing for world peace and lasting peace. Uh, well, I mean, our fir our first By far, our first thing that we want to do, the first element of, of the overall transaction is ending the war. But if, uh, just as we&amp;#39;re doing with Ukraine, if we could do some economic development in terms of Russia and getting things that we want. Uh, something like that would be possible, yes in in the US, go ahead. Can you explain the rationale of having US vote against the UN resolutions that Ukraine proposed and also the US proposed. Uh, I would rather not explain it now, but it&amp;#39;s sort of self-evident, I think. Mr. President, first talked about increasing the tariffs on products from the European Union. Is that still something you want to do? OK Well, it&amp;#39;s not increasing it&amp;#39;s reciprocal. So whatever they charge us, we&amp;#39;re charging them. So it&amp;#39;s not a question of increasing, uh, if they charge us 20%, we charge them 20%. If they charge us 30 or 40%, then we do that too. So that would be on the European Union, but that really would be respect with respect everybody. Uh, it&amp;#39;s reciprocity. So reciprocal, whatever they charge us, we charge them. Nobody has a problem. Even you, I see you don&amp;#39;t have a problem anymore, right? Mr. President, are you thinking of going to Moscow soon, maybe in May for the 9th of May for the anniversary. I mean, not soon, but I would be certainly, uh, if, if this all gets settled down, which I think it will, sure, I would go there and you&amp;#39;d come here too on the night of May for the on the red square. I don&amp;#39;t know, 9th of May, no, I don&amp;#39;t, I think that&amp;#39;s pretty, that&amp;#39;s pretty soon, but no, at the appropriate time I would go to Mos, within weeks. Yeah, I don&amp;#39;t you think so? I&amp;#39;d like to ask, have you, I think we could end it within weeks if we&amp;#39;re smart. If we&amp;#39;re not smart, it&amp;#39;ll keep going and we&amp;#39;ll keep. Losing uh young Beautiful people that shouldn&amp;#39;t be dying. And we don&amp;#39;t want that and remember what I said. This could escalate into a third World War. And we don&amp;#39;t want that either Mr. President, you&amp;#39;re off with Steve Weoff suggested a temporary ceasefire in the conflict, but the Russian government. Deny that out of 10, you worried that they&amp;#39;re not feeling in good faith. No, I think they At some point we&amp;#39;ll agree to that, I think they probably wanted to, and I think once you have a ceasefire, it&amp;#39;s going to end because they&amp;#39;re not going from a ceasefire back to war. I think people have had. Therefore, I&amp;#39;m, I&amp;#39;m just glad I was able to help because there was no communication with Russia. Until I came along, Biden didn&amp;#39;t communicate, he couldn&amp;#39;t communicate with his own child. So Biden didn&amp;#39;t communicate, he couldn&amp;#39;t, it was terrible. He hadn&amp;#39;t spoken to Putin in 3 years. You&amp;#39;re trying to end the war. People are being killed every week, thousands of people are being killed, soldiers in this case, mostly. Also towns, you know, his missiles go in and back and forth, uh, now it&amp;#39;s, it&amp;#39;s a shame this should have never happened. This is a very sad, this is gonna go down in the history books. This is a very sad moment because that should have been stopped. That should have never started and if it did start, it should have stopped the first week, not 3 years later. OK, just ask. The description. It. Don&amp;#39;t guaranteed security. European. uh They are not me. That is the most beautiful language. I have no idea what he&amp;#39;s saying, but that. Elegant, beautiful language. Go ahead, please. This is a question that was asked by several. What we need to do is make sure that we are building peace. We have deterrence. We have deterrence capabilities that have been res restored as President Trump said there won&amp;#39;t be any more problems. We&amp;#39;ve seen the US reengagement, and the message that that sends to Mr. Putin. We have deterrents which will allow a truce to take place, verification of that truce, and then a peace agreement can be put in place so that we can start rebuilding Ukraine with security guarantees, and we have a role to play in that. Again, I&amp;#39;m not preempting any discussions, but we&amp;#39;ve spoken about Ukraine&amp;#39;s sovereignty, and that has been a subject of discussion between the US and Ukraine. We have also been working closely with our British partners this week. We&amp;#39;ve shared this information with other European countries, and we are ready and willing to provide those security guarantees, which could perhaps include troops, but they would be there to maintain peace. They would not be along the front lines. They would not be part of any conflict, they would be there. to ensure that the piece is respected. Our assistance may include other capacity building, perhaps for the military. We see US credibility here. We each have our role to play, but it will be done in a united fashion. give up part of his territory. Well, we&amp;#39;re gonna see, it&amp;#39;s a negotiation that&amp;#39;s just starting and, you know, they&amp;#39;ve been fighting and there&amp;#39;s been a lot of land that&amp;#39;s been taken, so we&amp;#39;ll have to see how that works out as part of the negotiation. Uh, I will say there was great unity in that room today, you know, we were. Skype or whatever, but it was great. Uh, tremendous unity today in that room with the other countries can they take it back? What they lost in the past years. That&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to do, is it, right? It&amp;#39;s not easy, you know, it&amp;#39;s asking whether or not, uh, You can take back the land that they lost. And I, I say that, yeah, perhaps some of it, yeah, I hope so, but that&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to do. But on the frozen. It&amp;#39;s gonna be something we&amp;#39;re talking about. Will you accept the European troops as peacekeepers, yeah, he will accept that I&amp;#39;ve asked him that question. You talk to me. I&amp;#39;ve asked him that question. Is going to lift the block on the look, if we do this deal, he&amp;#39;s not looking for More worried doesn&amp;#39;t mind, but I&amp;#39;ve specifically asked him that question. He has no problem with it. Is France going to lift the block on the 300 billion and frozen Russian assets in Belgium, France has opposed unfreezing it to pay Ukraine and compensate the US for its support. Is France going to lift its opposition to that. This is, I mean, we speak about frozen assets, we already used them to back precisely the loans negotiated at the G7. And it&amp;#39;s part of the sanctions, so it will depend on the follow up of the discussions, but clearly we respect international law. It&amp;#39;s just frozen assets now. You can take the proceeds of the frozen assets, but you cannot take the assets themselves because it&amp;#39;s Not respecting international law, and we want to respect one than the other. You can take the proceeds from it, how can you not do that? Because it&amp;#39;s very different. You keep the assets, you take the proceeds because they are paralyzed in a certain way. You take the proceeds during the wartime, but you keep the assets and it&amp;#39;s part of the negotiation at the end of the war because I mean this work goes to the office of a lot of money. And this is the responsibility of Russia because the aggressor is Russia should be compensated, so at the end of the day, this frozen asset should be part of the negotiation. All in all Who friends support the US being compensated? I support the idea to have Ukraine first being compensated because they are the ones who have lose a lot of their fellow citizens and being destroyed by these attacks. Second, all of those who paid for could be compensated, but not by Ukraine, by Russia, because there wasn&amp;#39;t want to aggress. Again just so you understand, Europe. is loaning the money to Ukraine. They get their money back. Now, in fact, to be, to be frank, uh, we paid, we paid 60% of the total defaults, and it was I like the US loans guarantee, grants, and we, we provided real money to be clear. We have 230 billion frozen assets in Europe. assets, but this is not. As a collateral of a loan because this is not our belonging. So they are frozen if at the end of the day in the negotiation we will have with Russia, they&amp;#39;re ready to give it to us. Super. It will be alone at the end of the day and Russia would have paid for that. If you believe that it&amp;#39;s OK with me. If they get their money back, we don&amp;#39;t, and now we do, but you know, that&amp;#39;s it should be the one that pays everybody back. Are they the aggressors? Well, we&amp;#39;re all we&amp;#39;re negotiating everything and everything&amp;#39;s on the table and we&amp;#39;ll see if we can get some land back and we&amp;#39;ll see about a lot of different things and we&amp;#39;re going to be making a little speech and uh say a few words and a little while we&amp;#39;re gonna have another meeting, a luncheon meeting, and we&amp;#39;ll see you in about 2 hours. OK? Thank you very much. Let&amp;#39;s go, let&amp;#39;s go thank you very much."

Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for World War.”\n\n---------\n\nReporter asking question: \"Would you support the idea to send European troops in Ukraine to back the ceasefire?\"\n\nDonald Trump, U.S. President: \"European troops may go into Ukraine as peacemakers. So when the agreement is done, they can watch that everything is followed properly. I don't think that's going to be a problem. And a lot of the European countries, I think, I don't want to speak for France, but I know that the president's talked about doing that also. I think that'll be a very good day when we can go in as peacekeepers as opposed to what's going on right now with everybody being killed.\"\n\nReporter asking question: \"Will they have U.S. backing?\"\n\nTrump:  \"Well, we're going to have a backing of some kind. And obviously the European countries are going to be involved.\"\n\nReporter: \"Will Putin accept European troops as peacekeepers?\"\n\nTrump: \"Yeah, he will accept that.

      "description": "(ASSOCIATED PRESS) Ukraine on Monday marked the bleakest anniversary yet of its war against the Russia invasion, with the country’s forces under severe pressure on the battlefield and the Trump administration apparently embracing the Kremlin in a reversal of U.S. policy.\r\n\r\nThe three-year milestone drew more than a dozen Western leaders to Kyiv for commemorative events in a conspicuous show of support. They warned of the war’s wider implications for global security and vowed to keep providing billions of dollars in support for Ukraine as uncertainty deepens over the U.S. commitment to help. Washington did not send any senior official to the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe fourth year of fighting could be pivotal as Trump uses his return to office to press for a peace deal.\r\n\r\nWorld security is at stake in talks over how the war ends, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned.\r\n\r\n“The autocrats around the world are watching very carefully whether there’s any impunity if you violate international borders or invade your neighbor, or if there is true deterrence,” she said.\r\n\r\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau echoed that sentiment. Canadians, he said, “believe deeply that it’s not just about Ukraine. It’s about the rules and the values and the principles of sovereignty, of independence, territorial integrity that protects every country in the world. All of us rely on those rules to be able to build peace and security.”",

      "captions": "all right overseas Germany&amp;#39;s Christian democrats the nation&amp;#39;s center right party has won that country&amp;#39;s federal election the party&amp;#39;s leader Friedrich MZ is likely to become the nation&amp;#39;s next Chancellor with his party securing 28 seats and roughly 29% of the vote the campaign&amp;#39;s focus was dominated by long-standing concerns over Germany&amp;#39;s economy and immigration policy current Chancellor Olaf Schultz&amp;#39;s left leaning party finished in third place with just 120 seats and 16% of the vote the nation&amp;#39;s far right afd party finished in second place winning 152 seats and roughly 21% of the vote nearly double its margin from the last federal election in 2021 let&amp;#39;s bring in former editor of the Financial Times lonel Barber live from Brussels where the EU holds most of its key meetings and staff writer at the Atlantic Ram wood as Liz piece posted just before the election is entitled Germany&amp;#39;s anti-extremist firewall is collapsing thank you all both so much for being with us uh Lionel why don&amp;#39;t we start with you uh you have the most fascinating shot of all and you were also in Brussels the deao capital of Europe um you know uh there was a belief that perhaps because musk Vance and others were leaning in and trying to support afd that they would do much better than the 20% uh that they&amp;#39;ve been projecting for the past several weeks I&amp;#39;m wondering is is this another example as we&amp;#39;ve seen in France with the last two elections of mcon where the center is held we have that Centrist Grand Coalition uh holding things together in Germany for the next few years what what are your thoughts well the center has barely held because the CDU as you say didn&amp;#39;t get over 30% of the vote it&amp;#39;s a disaster for Olaf uh the bookmaker spreadsheet guy Schultz the chancellor his party center left got around 15 16% of the vote and the hard right they doubled their vote share compared to four years ago now that means that the afd back by musk and I think more than a few others in the Trump Administration are now the opposition however here&amp;#39;s the sliver of good news there is likely to be a Centrist what they call a grand Coalition between center right center left and sort of right which will keep out the afd something to watch will Elon Musk say that there should be that the afd deserves to come into government that would be a shocker well I I I it looks like Elon Musk interfering uh and uh Germany&amp;#39;s elections work worked about as effectively as a German politician uh trying to tell people in Peoria Illinois how to vote um I&amp;#39;m wondering also while we&amp;#39;re looking at at good news here I&amp;#39;m wondering whether the business community may think it&amp;#39;s good news that a pro bus uh German leader is now in charge because the German economy is right now uh struggling as much as it is number one and number two um we we played a clip earlier in this show of 10 years of warning from warning Joe uh that that the eu&amp;#39;s immigration policy was too LAX and it would lead to the rise of far-right parties I&amp;#39;m wondering if m is not uh fing that void now not being a far right conservative but at least speaking to the concerns of Germans after you know Merkel uh brought in a Million Syrian refugees without even screening most of them well Joe you&amp;#39;re dad right about the uh handling IM immigration and the government actually in Germany has already uh suspended Shen and the free movement of uh people within the EU and into Germany and there are going to be much tighter immigration measures and the success of the hard hard right is definitely due to uh fears about immigration also cry um now to answer your other question we&amp;#39;re not in Washington here where president Trump has got total fty for the moment from the Republican Party he&amp;#39;s got all his nominees through you were talking about cash Patel and others tossi gavan with Germany Mr MZ Chancellor elect m is going to have to negotiate a coalition and that will be if it&amp;#39;s with the center left what the business Community are looking for is can he actually push through economic reforms can he get a release on the debt break which is uh like a balanced budget amendment that&amp;#39;s a law which is preventing investment I mean Joe ma the German trains don&amp;#39;t even run on time as well as the British we&amp;#39;re in a terrible State regarding German infrastructure well the trains had always been of course the line there um GR uh you were covering for a while now um the rise of afd in fact you spent time in Germany you even attended at least one of their rallies you did a deep dive that&amp;#39;s on the Atlantic site now uh a mustre um tell us a little bit about what you learn there and it and the party&amp;#39;s new and growing role in that country yeah the main thing I learned was that the afd was aiming its fire at the CDU at the center right I mean that the afd was was saying the center right which just won this election has to be destroyed totally dismantled that they invoked Trump they invoked Elon Musk and they said they they led the way they destroyed the GOP as it existed before and we&amp;#39;re going to do the same thing to the CDU now the CDU having won it looks like a victory for them but the afd also measures their victories in different ways too so getting one in five German voters for them was a huge Victory because it meant that they couldn&amp;#39;t be ignored in the future so what what they might be shut out of government they&amp;#39;re very likely to be shut out of government but what they were afraid of was that they would have a showing that would be poor enough that they could actually be be banned as a party be investigated by law enforcement and what they&amp;#39;ve got is is a showing that makes it impossible for them to be completely ignored politically so grahe talk about the people you met at the afd rally I mean there&amp;#39;s a kind of a slightly easy language in which this is the inheritors of the fascist party and uh is racist um and Islam uh homophobic the people you met and talked to how did they feel about that perception of them uh they were sincerely offended by it um you know there have been many cases where afd supporters afd members have said things that charitably we could say were neutral about the history of Germany and about the SS so um the afd has quite a lot to to answer for at most of the r that I went to and I I went to some of the strongholds of the afd and went to their political rallies uh there was no uh there were no racial slurs that were used uh there was more anger directed toward actually toward the center right politicians of Germany than toward immigrants but look this is a party that that that adopted as a slogan Alice for Deutschland Alice is the name of the leader of the party Alice for Deutschland is also the one of the motos of the uh Storm Troopers of Nazi Germany so they they seem to kind of encourage a bit of ambiguity some dog whistles some understanding that uh even if we&amp;#39;re going to be personally not racist personally not offended in many cases the party as a whole is okay with some of the iconography some of the symbolism of Nazism and that&amp;#39;s a very that&amp;#39;s a very unsettling thing to hear when spoken especially in German so Graham with that that&amp;#39;s the backdrop here right they may be trying to project a little more professionalism but the the underpinnings are all there very disturbing as you say so how would you forecast now coming off of what for them was a remarkable showing uh this weekend even if a little less than maybe some of them had hoped or um that Elon Musk and JD Vance perhaps had hoped um you know how do you foresee the role they&amp;#39;ll play going forward now with this new government in place in Germany so I think you can look at some of the states where they&amp;#39;ve been very popular so I was in the state of turingia one of the places where they&amp;#39;ve been most popular in the past and in fact in state Parliament they won a plurality of votes there but they were not in government because all the other parties joined a coalition against them and made them um just shut them out so what was the effect of that supporters of the afd were angrier than ever they their their view was even when we win we lose so now that they haven&amp;#39;t um you know got enough of a share of the federal Parliament to actually be in in government to be most likely in government in any Coalition they&amp;#39;re still going to feel like they&amp;#39;ve been shut out so I feel like this is sort of a reckoning postponed with the afd and the rise of the far right in Germany because their their supporters are going to look at their fairly strong showing a stronger showing than ever before and see that they&amp;#39;re still being shut out and that&amp;#39;s going to make them mad and whenever the next Reckoning comes the real Reckoning it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going to be pretty severe and of course their strongest showing in East Germany H former East Germany sta rider for the Atlantic grahamwood thank you so much his latest pieces available to read online now um hey Lionel uh back to you in Brussels let&amp;#39;s talk about Europe&amp;#39;s response to Ukraine uh the growing Ukraine crisis on the third anniversary of the War I I&amp;#39;ve been showing the Wall Street Journal editorial uh talking about all the times Vladimir Putin has lied to American leaders uh We&amp;#39;ve of course had Murdoch&amp;#39;s Wall Street Journal editorial page uh uh the New York Post even uh someone Fox News striking out uh against Vladimir Putin saying clearly he is the dictator who began the invasion and yet Republicans uh Republican Senators for the most part strangely silent um how&amp;#39;s that being received in Europe and what does it mean long term for the eu&amp;#39;s relationship not only with the United States but also its relationship uh towards the idea of uh defending itself now without the help of the United States uh right now Joe the biggest concern in Europe is that we just won&amp;#39;t have a seat at the table when the future of Ukraine and the security guarantees or not and the future economic of Ukraine will will be discussed at the moment it&amp;#39;s a US Russian discussion a trump Putin discussion and there&amp;#39;s a big contrast with for example 1989 1990 after the fall of the German War uh Berlin War the Bush Administration went to great efforts to bring the Europeans on board and actually strike a partnership of equals as in their words with helmet Cole of ger Germany uh right now Germany has been treated as an adversary the thing to watch is this week president macron will have talks with President Trump and our own K starma what&amp;#39;s he going to say well he will I believe send a message if you get this wrong this could be like Afghanistan The Retreat it could be chaos so be careful what you wish for dismay in other words that so many people in the Republican party and in mauga are not prepared to say the word dictator when it comes to President Putin and instead want to co up you know that is that is uh that is of course distressing I will say interesting uh two people who you would not normally put together Kier starmer and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina issuing the same warning Lindsey Graham letting Donald Trump know that if you think Afghanistan was bad The Retreat from afgh fistan just wait that will be nothing compared to Ukraine if you turn it over to Vladimir Putin and Frances uh Emanuel macron is actually at the white house right now as we speak"

      "language": "en",
      "captions": "The Conservative Party coming out on top in Germany&amp;#39;s snap election, defeating the Social Democrats, who came in third, surging to second place. The alternative far right, the strongest finish for the party since World War Two. Issues at the forefront immigration, the economy and the United States. Conservative leader Friedrich Marx, now on track to become chancellor and stressing a need for German independence from America. And the absolutely ominous it is dusty. My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that step by step we can really achieve independence from the United States, from Donald Trump is cloud dust in an economy. But at the very least, after Donald Trump&amp;#39;s statements last week, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans in this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe. CNN&amp;#39;s Melissa Bell joins us live now from Berlin. Melissa, you have said that that this incoming chancellor wants to put together a governing coalition by Easter. How likely is that? Looking increasingly likely, we understand that he spoke with his potential coalition partners, the SPD, last night. That&amp;#39;s according to German media. And just picking up from what expect the likely next chancellor of Germany was just saying there, Kayla, there is this sense of urgency for Europeans. Remember that Germany is a Europe&amp;#39;s largest economy. It is also a powerhouse of the European Union politically. And as he pointed out last night at his victory speech, because of course, his party came first, even though that doesn&amp;#39;t automatically makes him making the next Chancellor. There are now discussions to form a coalition. It is because of the stance of the American administration that the world, he said, will not wait for us. And German politics has this tradition of functioning relatively slowly. There is this inherent stability in the system. Coalition talks can take some time. He announced that he believed a coalition could be found by Easter. And what we understand this morning, from looking again at the results, the fact that two parties have been excluded from the parliament because they did not meet that 5% bar of the vote, the reshuffling of the parliamentary seats means that it looks as though the CDU and the SPD have the seats they need to form a two party coalition, which is likely to prove much more stable than the three party coalition that collapsed at the end of last year. Kayla. Melissa the surge in popularity among the far right party is something that President Trump has been celebrating, suggesting it&amp;#39;s a global shift toward a more conservative ideology and even drawing some parallels between Germany and the United States. Is that how you see it across the Atlantic? There is definitely something that&amp;#39;s happened here in this political cycle in Germany that is reflected in other European countries as well, and that is a surge in parties representing the far right that tend to be euroskeptic, that tend to want to end aid to Ukraine is the case of the AfD here in Germany that are much more aligned with the policies of the current American administration, and they are making extraordinary headway. The AfD doubled its score on the last elections, it believes, and Elon Musk has just congratulated it, tweeting in the sense as well that the one to keep an eye on will be the next federal elections in four years time. The AfD believes that they can continue building on that support they have, specifically in the former, in the parts of the former East Germany where there is a great deal of disaffection about the state of the economy in a great deal of concern about immigration policy. And I think one of the most interesting things you&amp;#39;ve seen this campaign is the whole of the political spectrum here in Germany moved to the right on those questions of immigration, not least the CDU, the Christian Democrats that are likely to be able to name the next chancellor in the shape of Friedrich kind of Melissa Bell in Berlin. Melissa. Thank you. The head of Germany&amp;#39;s opposition, opposition conservatives says his absolute priority is to strengthen Europe and achieve independence through the United States. That pledge from Friedrich Merz comes as preliminary results show the center right leader is on track to become Germany&amp;#39;s next chancellor. Sunday&amp;#39;s vote also saw a strong second place showing for the far right alternative for Germany party, followed by Chancellor Olaf Schulz&amp;#39;s Social Democrats in third. The AfD leaders say that performance in this election means they are the party of the future and cannot be ignored. Joining me now from Germany is Deborah Cole, Berlin correspondent for The Guardian and you know, the far right isn&amp;#39;t right if we just take a look at their numbers. It&amp;#39;s been an absolute surge and they now have a really strong position in Parliament and will have an effect on policy that way, even if they don&amp;#39;t make the government. That&amp;#39;s right. I mean, they are the strongest opposition party. The AfD had a historic night. They doubled their support compared to the last election in 2021. So this firewall that you might have heard about that bars cooperation by the mainstream parties with the AfD is going to come under massive pressure in the coming years. how did they do it? I mean, what&amp;#39;s your understanding, having reported on the election, having spoken to people, what is resonating about the far right? Because I know obviously economy was a huge issue here. Also immigration. Did they just speak better to those issues than the left? For example? Well, there there are party of anger. They&amp;#39;re a party of, you know, of of protest, when it comes to their economic plans. very few voters cite anything that they, you know, would choose to do as being something that would be likely to help Europe&amp;#39;s top economy get back on its feet. The real issue, and they managed to completely harness the debate and, really, you know, call the tune for the other parties on immigration. And, during this campaign, you saw a series of, of deadly attacks, seemingly unconnected attacks. that were blamed on, on migrants where the suspects in each case, were asylum seekers, who had come to Germany in the last years and, and become radicalized on German soil as it, as it seemed. And, that really spooked a lot of, German voters. It was, it was a scary time for a lot of people. And the AfD, apparently for some voters, for 20% of voters, made the case that, under a government led by them, that this wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened. The winning conservatives also spoke a lot about immigration, didn&amp;#39;t they? So we&amp;#39;ve seen a whole shift to the right, in this election. how much is that got to do with the success of Donald Trump&amp;#39;s policies in America? Hmhm. Yeah. I mean, you you I&amp;#39;m sure, your, your viewers noticed, the, quite high profile. And for the German political establishment, shocking interventions, by, members of the Trump camp, including Elon Musk and, then at the Munich Security conference, JD Vance, on behalf of the AfD calling for an end to the firewall and, Musk saying that really, the AfD was the only party that could, you know, rescue Germany now, it didn&amp;#39;t seem to have much of an impact on the polls. I mean, if you look at, where they were at the end of December and then where they were last night, they landed on 21%, which is about where they then, you know, for for months and months. that said, that those interventions which last night, Matt, the winner of last night&amp;#39;s election, you know, called them brazen. These, these interventions, by Musk and Vance. I think it&amp;#39;s interesting, though, isn&amp;#39;t it? You could you could see, a slight separation between Musk and Trump on this issue, though, because Musk very clearly throwing himself behind the far right than we saw. And Trump hasn&amp;#39;t done that. but Trump has thrown his support behind the conservatives. So, do you see different levels of extremity really, between these two key players in America and how they played into the German election? yeah, I wouldn&amp;#39;t I wouldn&amp;#39;t speak to that. I mean, I think that his his message last night on On Truth Social was quite ambiguous. You know, he had said it was a great day for Germany. and I think you could read that either way. and I think many people here read that as support for the AfD, actually. but this is the man he&amp;#39;s going to have to be dealing with. you know, Trump has threatened these, these punishing tariffs. And Germany in Europe is going to be hit hardest by them. And so I would expect, you know, maps to be, able having those conversations with him. Okay. Deborah Kohl in Berlin, thank you so much for joining us today."

      "captions": "in Global News Germany&amp;#39;s conservative party won the country&amp;#39;s general election over the weekend Friedrich Ms is set to become the next Chancellor he&amp;#39;s going to begin talks this week to form a coalition government joining us right now is Megan O Sullivan the director of Harvard&amp;#39;s belfer Center for Science and international Affairs she served in both Democratic and Republican administrations including as Deputy National secretary advisor in the George W Bush Administration and Megan thank you for being here just taking a look at these elections in Germany uh probably not the biggest news that the conservative party won but that the farri party actually picked up about 20% of the vote and a very wide turnout of about 84% of the possible voters turning out for this vote what what does this mean what&amp;#39;s the sea change here sure good morning Becky well as you said this is definitely a step in the direction to the right for the German electorate with the alternative for Germany the afd that you mentioned receiving 20% of the votes which is not just a large amount in an absolute sense but this is a doubling of the votes that they received just four years ago and I think it&amp;#39;s a reflection of something we&amp;#39;ve seen in other in other countries in the United States as well is a dissatisfaction with the government um around issues not only related to the economy but very much related to immigration I was in Munich uh just a few weeks ago and certainly you heard the dissatisfaction of more than three and a half million uh refugees from Ukraine Afghanistan Syria having come into Germany and many Germans feeling that they haven&amp;#39;t uh been well integrated and that they&amp;#39;re uh they&amp;#39;re keeping certain services and security from uh Germans who have lived there for decades how does this play out because while they may not be able to be in power at this point they may not make any decisions because none of the other parties will work with them at this point they are going to move the the national discourse and and and change how Germany does things I think it&amp;#39;s correct to say that they&amp;#39;ve definitely and their success has shed a light not just on these particular issues but also on the polarization within German politics particularly between East Germany and West Germany where in East Germany you had a very strong showing for this party that we&amp;#39;re discussing on the whole though at least with the the the polls that are coming at the exit polls that are coming out today it looks as though uh friederick MZ and the Christian Democratic Union and the Socialist Democratic Union will be able to form a government without too many other parties um and that will make for a more stable Coalition actually than was had in the in the previous government that created a lot of uncertainty and a lot of paralysis so in some ways the the good news um for the conservatives and for German Politics as a whole in Germans who wanted a more stable government is that the election results you know while definitely revealing the rise in support for this far-right party also produced a result that I think there&amp;#39;s some hope for a more stable government which is what Germans need particularly as the presidency of Donald Trump uh presents very new challenges to Germany and to Europe as a whole and particularly as it relates to Ukraine but also trade let&amp;#39;s talk about the Ukraine angle first on this uh we know that this this government is likely to spend more on defense and particular they&amp;#39;re going to have to pick up some of the check that the United States is no longer going to be picking up the the tab for what when it comes to Ukraine how does this change uh where are where do things stand right now particularly with the negotiations that are taking place between the United States and Ukraine Germany but Europe as a whole I would say is in a very serious moment of uh Despair and hopefully Galvan you know in the sense that they need to I should have said they should be galvanized to support um Ukraine but also their own independence and their own military in fact uh the person you mentioned friederick MZ who&amp;#39;s most likely or almost certainly to become Chancellor said just today that his top priority is to be reinforcing European strength so that Europe can gradually move away from its dependence on the United States this is frontmost in the minds of European leaders but it won&amp;#39;t be easy because for decades as we know the Europeans have been very reliant on the US for their Collective defense um it&amp;#39;s not that Europe has not contributed to Ukraine and in fact Europe has spent $65 billion collectively um on Ukraine&amp;#39;s defense whereas the United States has spent 67 billion um so there has been a big contribution but it will be very hard for Europe not only to replace the United States and Ukraine I think that would be extremely difficult but to provide more of its own security it will need to do incredibly hard things one study said that Europeans will need to mobilize another 300,000 Europeans um for the defense of Europe in the in the possibility of u a conflict with Russia we&amp;#39;ll need to spend more than three three about three and a half% of its GDP on defense uh these are very tall orders at a time when the continent is struggling economically as well so these are going to be some of the priorities for for um Chancellor or soon to be Chancellor MZ and a German government as well as its European um allies"

      "description": "The euro rose and German mid-cap stocks rallied on speculation that Germany’s election results may pave the way for more spending to boost economic growth. Germany’s conservative leader Friedrich Merz emerged as the winner, but the results gave his bloc just one clear path to power with intense pressure to form a government.  While Merz’s CDU/CSU alliance won 28.6% of the votes, the only centrist two-party option for a majority in the Bundestag is to partner with Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s battered Social Democrats. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, doubled support to become the second-strongest party with 20.8%, it's highest percentage in over a decade.\n\nThe Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe.

OLAF SCHOLZ SUFFERS THE WORST\nDEFEAT SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR.\nTHE EURO IS HIGHER WHILE DAX FUTURES ARE IN THE GREEN.\nDONALD TRUMP&amp;#39;S ADVISORS DECLINED TO DESCRIBE RUSHER AS\nTHE AGGRESSOR. SKULL AND SKI -- ZELENSKYY SAYS\nHE WILL STEP DOWN IF NATO MEMBERSHIP IS GUARANTEED. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; DAX FUTURES AND EUROS STOCKS\nFUTURES POINTING TO GAINS. GOALS SLIPPED OFF ALL-TIME\nHIGHS -- GOLD SLIPPED OFF ALL-TIME HIGHS.\nTHE COUNT DOWN TO THE OPENING TRADE STARTS NOW. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE RAN A TOUGH CAMPAIGN BUT NOW WE WILL TALK TO EACH OTHER\nAND REESTABLISH A VIABLE GOVERNMENT AS QUICKLY AS\nPOSSIBLE. KRITI: A CHANGE AFOOT IN GERMANY WITH\nTHE WORST DEFEAT SINCE WORLD WAR II FOR OLAF SCHOLZ BUT THERE IS A REGIME CHANGE, A\nVAST RAMP UP. THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WE SEE REAL POLICY CHANGE, TALKING\nABOUT MILITARY, IMMIGRATION, TRYING TO SWERVE ECONOMIC IMPACT WHEN GERMANY\nUNDERPERFORMS, THE PAIN AND THE GAIN WITH A CYCLICAL\nECONOMY, CAN THEY AMEND THE ISSUE? ANNA:\nWE HEARD ABOUT GETTING THIS DONE SOON, BY EASTER, IS THAT\nTHE LEVEL OF URGENCY THAT THE WORLD IS LOOKING FOR? WE HEARD FROM MEMBERS ABOUT\nECONOMY POLICY. LIZZIE: OUTPERFORMANCE OF THE AFD, THEY\nCOULD VETO LOOSENING OF THE DEBT RAY RISKING A TRADE WAR, A LOT HAPPENING HERE\nEYES ARE ON THE NEXT ELECTION. ANNA:\nTHEY SAID THEY WILL HUNT DOWN THEIR RIVALS. INTERESTING THAT WE HAD\nPRESIDENT TRUMP CONGRATULATING FREDERICK AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN\nMUCH OF THE AMERICANS WEIGHING IN ON THE COALITION. KRITI: A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS IN THE\nU.S. ARE SIMILAR TO GERMANY,\nIMMIGRATION AND WE SHOULD REMEMBER FREDERICK MIRSKY\nREPRESENTS THE ALLIANCE BUT INHERITED THAT FROM ANGELA\nMERKEL, THE RISE OF THE FAR RIGHT HIGHLIGHTING IMMIGRATION ON THE RESOURCES, THAT HAS BEEN\nTHE NARRATIVE WE HEARD FROM FREDERICK.\nWE NEED TO GET INDEPENDENCE FROM THE U.S.. FIGHTING WORDS. ANNA: REALLY INTERESTING AND DAX\nFUTURES ARE HIGHER IN THE EURO IS HIGHER, WE MIGHT ONLY HAVE\nTWO PARTIES , RATHER THAN FISCAL STIMULUS, THEY HAVE 34%, SOMETHING THAT\nSTARTS TO DON. LIZZIE: THE CENTER HELD AND TAX RISES, THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO FUEL\nTHE MARKET. KRITI: THIS IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE MARKETS ARE EXCITED BUT THE DAX HAS\nBEEN OUTPERFORMING ON A MONSTER RUN SO THE ACHILLES&amp;#39; HEEL IS A BIG BENEFACTOR FOR GERMAN\nECONOMICS AND ELECTION OVERHANG, SO MANY EURO SHORTS\nARE BEING REMOVED. LIZZIE: THE DEBT BREAK IS CRUCIAL TO THE WAR IN UKRAINE AND WE HAD\nZELENSKYY REJECTING A DEMAND AND THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR MARKER OF THE WAR, A REALLY\nCLEVER MOVE CALLING TRUMP&amp;#39;S BOLA AND SHOWING IT IS NOT THE PROBLEM IN THE U.S. RESOLUTION, WHO WOULD NEVER\nAGREE, THIS IS WHAT ZELENSKYY IS TRYING TO SPELL HOW. ANNA:\nSO THEY ARE NOT SEEING EYE TO EYE AND WE ARE AWAITING NEWS\nWHEN IT COMES TO DEFENSE BUT THE EU COMMISSION IS STEPPING\nUP AND WE WILL WATCH THAT. WORLD LEADERS ARE GATHERING AND\nPLENTY OF DIPLOMACY EXPECTED. KRITI: THIS ALL FEEDS INTO THE STORY\nAND 93% OF GERMANY&amp;#39;S IMPORTS COME FROM THE U.S., THESE WILL ALL FACTOR IN TO THE ALLIANCE\nAND CERTAINLY RIGHT HERE IN GERMANY. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHAT ARE OUR EXPECTATIONS\nARE FISCAL SPENDING? WILL BE JOINED BY THE EUROPEAN EQUITY HEAD AND BE JOINED BY MILES A BRADY AND THOMAS L\nHAZLETT, PLUS ESTHER, A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE. LIZZIE: LOTS OF DATA INCLUDING GEICO DATA AND NVIDIA EARNINGS AND THEN GERMAN CPI AND DATER KIND\nOF DISAPPOINTING BUT U.S. STOCKS ON FRIDAY. ANNA: PLENTY OF DIPLOMACY AND WE NOW\nTHE FOREIGN AFFAIRS REPRESENTATIVE WILL MAKE THEIR WAY TO TALK TO TRUMP ABOUT\nUKRAINE AND NVIDIA AND MICROSOFT SUGGESTING NUMBERS\nTELL THEM MICROSOFT IS ON THE MARGINS. KRITI: COMING FULL CIRCLE BECAUSE WE\nTHINK OF TECH AS GROWTH BUT GIVEN BILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF CASH, IT HAS TURNED INTO A\nSTORY WITH NO SURPRISE THEY ARE PULLING BACK. LIZZIE:\nLET&amp;#39;S GET TO WHAT ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW. POPE FRANCIS IS IN CRITICAL\nCONDITION, STILL RECEIVING OXYGEN FOR HIS BREATHING WITH\nRENAL FAILURE. HE CONTINUES TO BE ON ALERT. MICROSOFT CANCELED LEASES FOR DATER CENTERS TO REFLECT\nCONCERNS, REITERATING THEIR SPENDING TARGET BUT DECLINING\nTO COMMENT. AND TRUMP TAKES AIM AT CHINA TO CURB SPENDING AND FEES THAT\nAMOUNT TO SWEEPING COURSE CORRECTIONS.\nREDUCING CHINA&amp;#39;S TRADE SURPLUS. SO INTERESTING DEVELOPMENTS AND\nWE GET THE SENSE THAT TRUMP IS IN SUCH A HURRY TO TURN TO\nCHINA ,. ANNA: THAT DOES SEEM TO BE THE\nABILITY OF THE WHITE HOUSE SO WE ARE BOMBARDED. I WAS TAKEN BY THE PBOC\nSUGGESTING CURRENCY IS IN FOCUS AND EFFORT TO DEVALUE THE\nDOLLAR. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WHETHER THE DOLLAR HAS\nPEAKED IS FEEDING BACK INTO CORPORATE NEWS REPORTING AFTER\nA TAKEOVER, PLUS ITALY&amp;#39;S SERVICES COMPANY AGREES TO\nMERGE WITH NORWAY. GERMANY&amp;#39;S FREDERICK IS SET TO\nBE THE NEXT CHANCELLOR, WE WILL TALK IN THAT CONTEXT NEXT. IF YOU WANT TO GET INVOLVED\nPLEASE DO. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE ARE STILL IN A WORLD OF SPECULATION, THE FUTURE OF\nGOVERNMENT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT. ANNA:\nTRADERS ARE HOPING GERMANY WILL BE A PIPIT TO REBOOT THE\nECONOMY AND WE WILL DIVE IN, LET&amp;#39;S GET MARKET RESPONSE WITH\nVALERIE. VALERIE: WE COULD GET A GOVERNMENT\nSOONER RATHER THAN LATER, THE EURO IS REACTING, WE ARE UP ON\nTHE EURO-DOLLAR, ABOVE 105 HANDLE WHICH IS IMPORTANT\nBECAUSE WE&amp;#39;VE TESTED IT AND FAILED TO SUSTAIN SO THAT IS\nKEY. FLIP ON AND CHECK ON THE HUNDRED DAY MOVING AVERAGE SO\nTHEY COULD MEAN WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A BREAKDOWN. ANNA: LET&amp;#39;S BRING IN THE CHIEF\nEUROPEAN ECONOMIST AT GOLDMAN SOME WE HAVE THE GERMAN ECONOMY\nAS A RESULT OF DETAILS VALERIE TALKED ABOUT. SHOULD WE LINK IT TOGETHER TO ACT AS A VETO TO BLOCK PLANS OR\nARE WE GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES? GUEST: THERE IS A CLEAR MANDATE AND IT\nSHOULD ALLOW FOR QUICK AGREEMENTS WITH ENOUGH POLICIES THAT SHOULD BE HELPFUL BUT AS\nYOU SAID THE FAR RIGHT AND FAR LEFT COULD STOP CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM EITHER BY REFORM OR BY A\nNEW VEHICLE FOR MILITARY SPENDING SO IT IS STILL\nPOSSIBLE BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME AND BE COMPLICATED. ANNA: I&amp;#39;M PROBABLY GETTING TOO FAR\nAHEAD OF MYSELF. MAYBE IT IS COMPLICATED BUT IT\nSEEMS IMPORTANT AND WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THE ABILITY OF\nGERMANY? ONE ANALYSIS THAT THEY COULD\nCLEAR EMERGENCY BUT THE BAR IS QUITE HIGH. GUEST: YOU CAN TRIGGERED THE SCHEME\nCLAUSE BUT ONLY FOR THE YEAR IT IS TRIGGERED SO IT DOESN&amp;#39;T REALLY HELP, STILL POSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD LINK IT TO\nSUPPORT, LOOK AT THE LOW IN SOME CHANCE AND THEN MOST\nIMPORTANTLY THERE IS THE CHANCE OF THE EU APPROACH TO RAISING\nSPENDING, DEBT FALL OUT OF THE DEBT BREAK. KRITI: THERE IS A THOUGHT THAT\nDEVELOPMENTS STAND TO NOT MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE AT A\nEUROPEAN LEVEL. WITH THE PROSPECT ACTUALLY\nTRICKLE INTO GERMAN PERFORMANCE? GUEST: THAT&amp;#39;S A GREAT QUESTION, THE MULTIPLIERS ARE SMALL AND\nMILITARY SPENDING IF IT IS FOR EQUIPMENT, WE THINK NEAR-TERM INCREASE IN SPENDING WOULD HAVE\nSMALL EFFECTS AS THE DEFENSE INDUSTRY SCALES, YOU COULD SEE\nA MORE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. KRITI:\nFOCUSING ON THE DEBT BREAK WHAT DOES THE TIMELINE LOOK LIKE? WHAT IS THE LAG IN TERMS OF\nAFFECTING THE ECONOMY? GUEST:\nUNLIKELY TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT BOOST. IN 26 OR 27 WE COULD SEE\nMORE SPENDING SO THE ECONOMY IS STILL FACING HEADWINDS FROM\nCHINA, UNLIKELY TO TURNAROUND QUICKLY, WILL STILL REFLECT\nGROWTH. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; VALERIE ASKED IF THE DOLLAR\nCOULD STAIN AND WHERE ARE YOU AT ON THAT? GUEST: YOU&amp;#39;RE SEEING SOME SUPPORT TO\nTHE EURO, THE SAME TIME I THINK IT WILL NEED TO BE SEEN AND BIG\nFACTOR IS TARIFF UNCERTAINTY, WE EXPECT THAT TO WEIGH ON THE\nSHOW. : REALLY GOOD TO TALK TO YOU,\nCHIEF EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT EURO-DOLLAR 105, EURO STOCKS\nHIGHER, MARKET CELEBRATING. ANNA: FUTURES ARE STILL UP AND I\nSUPPOSE THE MARKET IS GETTING WHAT IT THOUGHT IT WOULD GET ON\nFRIDAY. AFD DID NOT DO ANY BETTER.\nLIZZIE: WE WILL DISCUSS PLANS TO FORM A\nCOALITION GOVERNMENT, MORE ON WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE.\nTHIS IS BLOOMBERG. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELCOME BACK, WE HAVE THE\nRESULTS, 8:30 A.M. IN BERLIN, THE FUTURE IS NOT STUNNING, UP BY JUST UNDER ONE\nPERCENT, S&amp;amp;P FUTURES ALSO HIGHER AND WE CAN SHOW YOU\nEUROPEAN YIELDS RISE SAYING, EUROPE UP BY TWO BASIS POINTS\nAND WE SEE MOVEMENT IF WE LOOK AT THE GERMAN CURVE, TO YEAR\nYIELDS ARE HARDLY UP AT ALL. LET&amp;#39;S HEAD BACK TO BERLIN. KRITI:\nREGIME CHANGE COMES WITH A STELLAR DEFEAT OF OLAF SCHOLZ. PIERRE JOINS ME OUT OF BERLIN\nAND THE QUESTION IS NOW WHAT? THE TALKING ABOUT THE\nLEADERSHIP CHANGE, WHERE DID WE GO FROM HERE? PIERRE: YOU GOT THE RESOLVE, AS GOOD AS IT COULD GET, POTENTIAL TO FORM A TWO-PARTY COALITION, THEY\nKNOW ONE ANOTHER AND THEY KNOW HOW TO FORM A COALITION BUT HE\nONLY HAS THE ONE OPTION WHICH MEANS THEY ARE LIKELY TO TRY TO\nEXTRACT AS MUCH AS THEY CAN SO HE HAS A CLEAR PATH BUT ONLY\nONE PATH. KRITI: WHERE DO THEY ONLINE? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BEING ABLE TO SPEND MORE MONEY IS CLEARLY ONE AREA, THEY\nNEED MORE MONEY, THEY DON&amp;#39;T WANT TO CUT SOCIAL SAID THEY.\nTHOSE ARE SOME AREAS. THEY DISAGREE ON SENDING WET\nBANDS, MISSILES, SOMETHING DEMOCRATS OPPOSED. AS THEY NEGOTIATE THESE ARE\nSOME THINGS THEY WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT. KRITI:\nTHE JOINT THAT STORY CAME UP, NOW YOU HAVE FRIEDRICH\nCOMPETING, WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP? GUEST: INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT, EUROPE HAS BEEN A\nLITTLE LEADERLESS AND NOW EVERYONE IS COMPETING AND\nFREDERICK WILL SAY I&amp;#39;M THE ONE TO DO THAT IN THE EU, HE SAID IS GOING TO GO TO WARSAW AND\nWANTS A DEEP RELATIONSHIP. I WAS IN WARSAW AND PEOPLE WERE\nHOPING MAERSK WOULD WIN BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD STEP UP. OLAF WAS NOT REALLY DRIVING SO\nWERE WATCHING HOW THIS DEVELOPS. KRITI: LET&amp;#39;S TALK DOMESTIC, SIMILAR TO\nANGELA MERKEL, WE KNOW THAT WAS THE KEY VOTING ISSUE.\nHOW MUCH ATTENTION DO WE NEED TO PAY TO THE AFD? GUEST: AFD IS AFFECTING POLICY. EVERYONE SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT ON IMMIGRATION, IT WAS THE TOP THING, IT WAS IMMIGRATION AND\nTHE ECONOMY, SO HE&amp;#39;S GOING TO HAVE TO DELIVER REFORM AND ON\nSECURITY SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL WATCH. KRITI: IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION IT IS\nCRUCIAL IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION FIGURES, NOT ONLY HERE BUT\nINTERNATIONALLY AS WELL. LIZZIE: WE WILL COME BACK TO THE GERMAN\nSTORY BUT I WANT TO LOOK AT CORPORATE RESULTS FROM THE BANK OF IRELAND, A SLIGHT MANUS AND\nNET INTEREST IS. WE WILL SEE HOW SHARES PERFORM\nAT THE MARKET OPEN BUT WE ARE SPEAKING TO THE BANK OF IRELAND\nCEO. TAKE US THROUGH YOUR OUTLOOK. OUR YOU GUIDING MARKET\nEXPECTATIONS HIGHER? GUEST: PLEADED HERE TO, THE MACRO BACKDROP REMAINS SUPPORTIVE,\nWELL-POSITIONED AND ASSETS ARE UP, COST EFFICIENCY IS KEY FOR STRONG PROFITABILITY, SO STRONG\nYEAR AND WE EXPECT ANOTHER STRONG PERFORMANCE. CERTAINLY IF I LOOK AT GROWTH IT IS UNDERPINNED BY DEMAND FOR\nCREDIT, THE BIG FACTOR WILL BE GROWING LOAN AND DEPOSIT BOOK AND WE EXPECT THE TERMINAL RATE TO GRAVITATE IN THAT\nENVIRONMENT, REGARDING EARNINGS ABOVE 17%. CANADA:\nTALK ABOUT THE RISKS FOR THE BUSINESS? WHAT ARE YOUR WORRIES?\nMILES: IN IRELAND WE EXPECT 12% GDP,\nTHAT&amp;#39;S FUNDAMENTAL AND LIKE BANK OF IRELAND AND, BOTH DOMESTIC AND EXPORTS PROVED\nSTRONG WITH AN EYE ON INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS. ANNA: FOR THIS SECTOR IT SEEMS DIGITIZATION AND AI AND\nTECHNOLOGY COULD HOLD ADVANCEMENTS BUT I WONDER WHAT\nTHAT DOES TO THAT HEADCOUNT? MILES: WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE AND\nONGOING ADOPTION LEVELS WILL BE LOWER THIS YEAR. CERTAINLY IT&amp;#39;S AN AREA OF\nCONCERN FROM IN IRELAND PERSPECTIVE, IT IS PERFORMING\nWELL IN MOST SECTORS SAW STRONG GROWTH. THERE ARE RISKS BUT OF THE\nFACTORS, EXPORTS, THAT ELEMENT BUILT UP OVER 40 YEARS AND NOT\nPRODUCING MOTOR VEHICLES, WE ARE PRODUCING MEDICINE SO I\nREGARD FOREIGN INVESTMENT AS A SOURCE OF STABILITY. ANNA: CAN I ASK YOU, WE&amp;#39;VE SEEN BANKS\nMOVING AWAY FROM TARGETS OR CHANGING THE NAME OF TARGETS,\nTRYING TO DO -- TRYING TO TALK LESS ABOUT DEI. THE IMPORTANCE? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO CHANGE AND OF COURSE THAT\nCAPTURES DEI. IT&amp;#39;S IMPORTANT WE HAVE A\nWORKFORCE REPRESENTING CUSTOMERS WE SERVE AND\nDIVERSITY IS A GOOD PROXY FOR INDEPENDENCE OF THINKING SO NO\nCHANGE. ANNA:\nTALKING TO A BUSINESS THAT HAD A FEMALE CEO.\nTHANK YOU, MILES, BANK OF IRELAND CEO. WE WILL STICK -- WELL, IT&amp;#39;S A\nCORPORATE EARNINGS AND AN M&amp;amp;A STORY, 4.1 BILLION EURO\nTAKEOVER AND TAKE AWAY ALSO. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BASED ON THIS THIS IS THE\nRIGHT PRICE, TO CREATE A BIG GLOBAL LEADER. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE WIN THE 2025 FEDERAL\nELECTION. THE WORLD WILL NOT WAIT FOR US\nOR FOR NEGOTIATION TALKS. KRITI: FREDERICK MAERSK SPEAKING AFTER\nTHE FEDERAL ELECTION. MARK CRANFIELD JOINING, PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU, DAX FUTURES ON A TEAR, IS IT TOO\nFAST AND TOO EARLY? WHAT ARE MARKETS THINKING? MARK:\nIT IS UNDERSTANDABLE TO HAVE RELIEF ESPECIALLY WITH\nDISAPPOINTMENT OVER FRENCH ELECTIONS AND AT LEAST GERMANY\nIS FORMING A GOVERNMENT QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY NEED TO\nCOORDINATED APPROACH, THEY JUST WANT A CLEAR MANDATE TO GIVE IT A SENSE OF DIRECTION AND IF POSSIBLE RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT\n, EQUITIES ARE DOING BETTER, IT&amp;#39;S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, TRADERS HAVE UNWINDING TO DO,\nSTILL THINKING THE U.S. DOLLAR WAS A STRONG STORY, THE\nDOLLAR HAS BEEN LOSING GROUND TO THE YEN, NOW THERE&amp;#39;S A GOOD\nCHANCE AGAINST THE DOLLAR. THE EURO AS A POTENTIAL BIG\nWINNER. ANNA: THAT LED TO A HIGH EURO. COMPARED TO NVIDIA NUMBERS WE\nSEEN CHINESE TECH DECOUPLING, WHERE DOES THAT TAKE US? MARK: THIS IS SOMETHING THAT\nDOMINATED TECH ANY TIME EARNINGS CAME ALONG, MACRO IMPACT AS WELL, THERE IS A HUGE\nSWING WITH KNOCK ON EFFECTS, THIS TIME IT&amp;#39;S A DIFFERENT STORY WITH ALIBABA&amp;#39;S EARNINGS\nBEATING EXPECTATIONS AND PEOPLE GETTING EXCITED. NVIDIA DOES NOT ALWAYS EXCITE\nEVERYONE, BUT CLEARLY THERE IS A CHANCE CHINA DECOUPLES, THEY\nVERY INTERESTING TIME. LIZZIE: MARK CRANFIELD, WE THANK YOU. TO GET MORE UP-TO-DATE TO DATE\nANALYSIS GO TO MLIV &amp;lt;GO&amp;gt;. LET&amp;#39;S GET YOUR STOCKS TO WATCH\nWITH JOE EASTON. JOE: FOOD DELIVERY DEAL ANNOUNCED, LOOKING AT JUST EAT TAKEAWAY\nTHEY RECOVERED 86%, GOOD TIME TO BUY THAT STOCK. ALSO DELIVERY HERO AND HELLO\nFRESH WITH POSITIVITY AND THEN NEWS OF A MERGER NOW IN THE OIL SERVICES SECTOR, A COMBINATION,\nTHEY HAD BEEN UNDERPERFORMING. WORTH NOTING THAT WE COULD SEE\nSTOCKS MOVING AROUND TODAY AND IN TERMS OF SHIPPING, MASSIVE\nDROP IN SHANGHAI FUTURES, PUTTING FEES ON SHIPS IN CHINA,\nA CLEAR DOWN ON THE INDUSTRY ACCORDING TO TRUMP. ALSO THOSE ARE THE BIG ONES TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON, THEM. GOLDMAN CUTS, KBW AND MATTEL\nARE UP. UBS COULD BE HIGHER. ANNA:\nJOE EASTON WITH M&amp;amp;A STORIES WE ARE TRACKING AND CORPORATE\nEARNINGS UPGRADES AND DOWNGRADES.\nALL THINGS GERMAN AND FOCUS. DAX FUTURES ARE UP. KRITI:\nMASSIVE MOVE OF COURSE. MARK CRANFIELD TALKED TO THEM SAYING THIS WAS A BIT OF A RELIEF RALLY, SOME SORT OF\nCOALITION AND THE LEADERSHIP QUESTION OUT OF THE SPD,\nPERHAPS PLAYING A BIGGER ROLE IN GERMANY, DOES THAT CHANGE\nTHE AGENDA? EURO STRENGTH MIGHT BE SHORT,\nTHAT SOMETHING MARK CRANFIELD TALKED ABOUT.\nI&amp;#39;M CURIOUS HOW MUCH IS TIED TO THE ELECTION OR WHAT YOU&amp;#39;VE\nSEEN? ANNA: IS THIS NEW, YEAH. WE&amp;#39;VE GOT THE GERMAN ELECTION\nVERSUS THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, LIZZIE. JOE WAS TAKING US THROUGH\nINDIVIDUAL MOVERS AND WE&amp;#39;VE HAD NEWS FLOWN ON JUST EAT TAKEAWAY\nAND THE REST OF THE SECTOR. LIZZIE:\nTHE GERMAN DAX IS EXPOSED IF YOU KEEP YOUR EYES ON DOMESTIC\nGERMAN STOCKS, WE LOOKED AT THE CHEMICALS, THE FINANCE, REAL\nESTATE AND UBS, OTHER STORIES AT PLAY. ANNA: SOMETIMES THE SMALL CAPS ARE OF\nINTEREST. WE WILL BRING YOU THE MARKET OPEN, WE HAVE INITIAL\nRESULTS OF THE GERMAN ELECTION, COALITION TALKS ARE STILL AHEAD.\nWE WAIT JUST UNDER TWO MONTHS OR SOONER FOR THE COALITION.\nTHE MARKETS ARE PLEASED WITH THE TIMESCALE. IT MIGHT BE ENOUGH IN GERMANY.\nWE WILL BRING YOU THE OPENING TRADE IN GERMANY.\nTHIS IS BLOOMBERG. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELCOME BACK TO THE OPENING\nTRADE UNTIL -- WE HAVE THE EUROPEAN PICTURES TO FACTOR IN.\nTHIS IS WHAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF FRIDAY&amp;#39;S SESSION.\nTHE EUROPEAN AND U.S. STORIES LOOK A BIT DETACHED\nFROM EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW SO MAYBE THIS IS A LIMITED USE BUT\nINTERESTING TO CAST OUR MINDS BACK TO FRIDAY.\nWE MADE GAINS ON THE EUROPEAN EQUITY MARKETS.\nTHE BLUE IS THE U.S. SESSION AND THE U.S.\nSESSION WAS WEIGHTED DOWN BY SHIFTING EXPECTATIONS AROUND\nU.S. TECH. WE HAD U.S. CONSUMER DATA, OTHER DATA OUT,\nALL LOOKING A BIT LACKLUSTER WHICH ADDED UP TO NEGATIVITY.\nBUT, WE HAVE THE GERMAN ELECTION AND EUROPE, EVEN\nBEFORE THE RESULTS OF THE GERMAN ELECTION, WAS KIND OF\nGOING -- KRITI: THE MARGIN OF THE FUTURE STORY\nBETWEEN THE DAX AND EURO STOXX 50 IS ENORMOUS.\nTHE FTSE 100 FLAT RIGHT NOW. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A DEBT\nSTORY AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS AN ELECTION STORY, OR A\nEURO-DOLLAR STORY AS WELL? LIZZY:\nIN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, WE HAVE THE NEWS THAT\nPROSUS IN THE TAKE AWAY FOR THE $4.3 BILLION GIVEAWAY.\nSAIPEM AND SUBSEA HAVE AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO CREATE AN OIL\nSERVICE COMBINED. KEEP AN EYE ON THE EUROPEAN\nVACCINE STOCKS AFTER RESEARCHERS DISCOVERED A NEW\nCORONAVIRUS WHICH COULD ENTER CELLS AS COVID-19.\nLET&amp;#39;S GET TO THE OPEN. ANNA: BUSY DEALING WITH THE RESULTS\nOF THE GERMAN ELECTION. LET&amp;#39;S GET TO THE MARKET OPEN\nAND SEE HOW THE MARKETS ARE DIGESTING THE RESULTS.\nWE HAVE A LOT OF NEWS FLOW FROM GERMANY TO PRICE IN.\nTHAT DOES NOT MEAN NECESSARILY WE GET AN OPEN ANY EARLIER THAN\nWE DO SO WE MIGHT BE GETTING A COUPLE OF MINUTES FOR THAT TO\nHAPPEN. THE STOXX 600 JUST OPENING INTO\nGREEN TERRITORY. FTSE 100 FALTERING NOW, FLAT.\nIN LONDON OR IN PARIS OR MADRID WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE ANY OF\nTHE BIG MOVES, WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE SOME UPSIDE ON THE\nGERMAN MARKET. DOWN BY .2%. WE DO HAVE, NOT MUCH CORPORATE\nEARNINGS NEWS BUT SOME CORPORATE NEWS FLOW IN THE\nSHAPE OF M&amp;amp;A STORIES TO KEEP US BUSY WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE DAX\nTO OPEN. LIZZY: WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR\nDELIVERY TO OPEN BUT AS WE LOOK AT THESE MARKETS SECTOR EARLY\nCOME AT THE MOMENT, THE YOU&amp;#39;VE GOT ABOUT HALF THE SECTORS IN\nPOSITIVE TERRITORY. UTILITIES LEADING THE GAINS. DOWN .6% OF STANDING.\nLOOKING FOR SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUAL -- INDIVIDUAL MOVERS.\nTHE EUROPEAN VACCINE STOCKS, GSK HIGHER. NOVO NORDISK HIGHER.\nCOULD THIS BE TO DO WITH THAT NEWS OF A NEW CORONAVIRUS,\nKEEPING AN EYE ON THOSE. THERE&amp;#39;S A LOT OF RED ACROSS THE\nSECTOR AS WELL, INCLUDING ROSCH AND BAVARIAN NORDIC AS WELL.\nANNA: A LOT TO DIGEST WHEN IT COMES\nTO GERMANY SO WE ARE WAITING FOR THE DAX TO OPEN UP.\nWE DO SEE OPENING PRICES ON SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL NAMES IN\nGERMANY SO THAT IS OF INTEREST. COMMERZBANK GOING HIGHER.\nNONE OF THE MOVES TO THE UPSIDE SEEMS SUBSTANTIAL. SIEMENS ENERGY IS QUITE A\nSUBSTANTIAL LOSER THIS MORNING. WE BEEN TRACKING ANYTHING\nCONNECTED TO DATA CENTERS AND AI AFTER WE SAW SOME\nINTERESTING NEWS LINES FROM ONE OF THE BREAKERS OF MICROSOFT. IT LOOKS TO BE -- SIEMENS\nENERGY IS ONE OF THE FOLLOWERS IN GERMANY. LIZZY: WE CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR THE DAX\nTO OPEN THIS MORNING. WE HAVE BASF SHARES OF 2%.\nWE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE BIG CAR NAMES, THE LIKES OF\nVOLKSWAGEN AND MERCEDES TO GIVE US A READ ON THE MARKET\nREACTION TO THIS GERMAN ELECTION RESULT. ANNA:\nMAY BE THE BIG PICTURE MOVES RATHER THAN THE NAMES. LET&amp;#39;S TALK TO MAXIMILIAN, THE\nHEAD OF EUROPEAN EQUITY ACROSS ASSET STRATEGY AT DEUTSCHE BANK\nRESEARCH. THERE&amp;#39;S AN EXPECTATION THE DAX\nSTORY GOES HIGHER. DOES IT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU\nTHAT WE ARE APPROACHING THE GERMAN ELECTION FROM A STOCKS\nPERSPECTIVE AS RISK ON? YES, WE MIGHT GET TO A\nCOALITION PRETTY QUICKLY VERSUS PREVIOUS GERMAN EXPECTATION BUT\nTHERE&amp;#39;S THIS POSSIBILITY THAT ANY CHANGE TO THE DEBT BREAK\nCOULD BE VETOED BY A BLOCKING MINORITY.\nSO, HOW RISK ON ARE YOU FEELING? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, REALLY MIXED RESULTS.\nTWO-PARTY GOVERNMENT IS EXTREMELY LIKELY AND I THINK\nTHAT IS AN IMPROVEMENT INCREMENTALLY TO WHAT WE HAD.\nI THINK THE MARKET SHOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE THAT.\nWE ARE SEEING MORE REFORMS MORE QUICKLY.\nHOWEVER, WE HAVE THIS TWO THIRDS MAJORITY NOT FOR THOSE\nCOMPANIES, NOT FOR THE CENTRIST PARTIES.\nTHE PROBLEM IS AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE DISCUSSING THIS FROM\nA SECTOR PERSPECTIVE AS WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE THIRD WITH THE\nFAR RIGHT AND THE FAR LEFT. SO, THE FAR RIGHT, THEY ARE\nOPPOSING SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. THEY WON&amp;#39;T BE VERY SUPPORTIVE\nON MORE DEFENSE FUNDING, SPENDING IF THAT&amp;#39;S GOING\nTOWARDS UKRAINE. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE THE\nLEFTISTS AND THEY WANT TO SPEND LESS ON DEFENSE.\nI AM CURIOUS HOW THE DEFENSE STOCKS WILL PERFORM THIS\nMORNING WHERE THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.\nI THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF QUESTION MARKS ON HOW POSSIBLE\nIS IT THAT GERMANY WILL HAVE A DEBT BREAK CHANGE.\nMAY BE LESS POSSIBLE THAN A WEEK AGO.\nNOT COMPLETELY SURE THE MARKET WILL HOLD OFF FROM WHAT WE&amp;#39;VE\nSEEN. LIZZY: AS WE&amp;#39;VE BEEN SPEAKING, THE DAX\nHAS OPENED, HIGHER .7% CURRENTLY. I HAVE TO ASK YOU, FRIEDRICH\nMERZ HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE URGENCY TO GET A COALITION DONE\nAND HAS GIVEN US A SENSE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD TAKE TWO MONTHS.\nHOW LONG IS TOO LONG IF THIS BULLISHNESS IS TO LAST?\nMAXIMILLIAN: YEAH, TWO MONTHS IS KIND OF THE\nAVERAGE WE HAVE SEEN. HE&amp;#39;D BEEN SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE\nONE BEFORE ISA -- I THINK THE CHANCE FOR THAT IS PRETTY HIGH.\nIT COULD BE QUICKER THAN THAT BECAUSE THE SPD AND CDU HAVE\nREPEATEDLY BEEN SAYING WE KNOW THERE&amp;#39;S AN URGENCY TO GET\nCOALITION AGREEMENT. APART FROM THE DIFFERENCES\nWE&amp;#39;VE SEEN OVER THE CAMPAIGNING, THE REST OF THE\nPARTIES, THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE PARTIES AGREE ON A LOT\nOF THINGS. I THINK WE WILL BE ON TRACK TO\nMEET MARKET EXPECTATIONS. THE EXACT DATE, I DON&amp;#39;T KNOW,\nBUT THERE&amp;#39;S A GOOD CHANCE WE HAVE A COALITION EARLY APRIL.\nLIZZY: I WANT TO GO OVER TO KRITI\nBECAUSE SHE WILL BREAK DOWN OF THE GERMAN MARKETS ARE FARING\nAT THE OPEN. KRITI? KRITI: THE DAX IS OFFICIALLY OPEN, AS\nEXPECTED, YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF BREADTH WHEN IT COMES TO\nTHIS MARKET. THE BIGGEST INDEX CONTRIBUTOR\nIS IN THE DEFENSE STOCKS. THIS WAS KIND OF EXPECTED WITH\nTHE NARRATIVE WE&amp;#39;VE SEEN THE LAST SIX WEEKS OR SO.\nLET&amp;#39;S START WITH THE MACRO AND WORK OUR WAY THROUGH.\nWITH THE BROADER GERMAN INDEXES, YOU&amp;#39;RE ARE SEEING\nGREEN ON THE SCREEN. DAX FLYING HIGHER BY OVER 1%.\nTHIS IS ENORMOUS WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THESE MOVES.\nIT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO JUST LOOK AT THE LARGE-CAP FACTOR\nBUT THE TRICKLE-DOWN AS WELL. THAT WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT.\nLET&amp;#39;S TALK ABOUT THIS FROM A MID-CAP AND SMALL-CAP\nPERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MASSIVE FISCAL\nSPEND, THE SMALL-CAP SECTOR MATTERS. HIGHER BY 1.5%. THE SMALLER YOU GO, THE BIGGER\nTHE IMPACT, HOW MUCH OF THAT IS RELATED TO THE ELECTION?\nLET&amp;#39;S GO TO THE AUTOS. I AM LOOKING AT THE PERCENTAGE\nCHANGE. NAMES LIKE BMW IMMEDIATELY COME\nTO MIND. A MOVE ABOUT 2%. ROSE THESE VENTS HIGHER BY 1.4%.\nVOLKSWAGEN, ALONG THE LAYOFFS, HIGHER BY 1.7%.\nEVEN PORSCHE HIGHER. DEFENSE IS A VERY KEY PIECE OF\nTHIS AS WELL. YOU ALSO SEE A BID INTO THE\nTECH SPACE. SAP HIGHER BY .5%. DEUTSCHE BANK HIGHER BY 1.2%.\nNOT IN ON THE RISK RALLY IS ADIDAS. THIS WILL BE CRUCIAL. THE CONSUMER SECTOR OF GERMANY\nALONGSIDE THE ENERGY SECTOR REALLY FALLING BEHIND AND NOT\nTAKING PART IN THE RALLY THIS MORNING, LOWER BY .1%.\nA QUICK CHECK ON THE BOND MARKETS.\nGERMAN BUND YIELDS ARE CRUCIAL. WE KNOW THE EURO HAS BEEN\nFLYING BUT THE BUND YIELDS STARTING TO SEE SOME CHANGE.\nIF YOU GO FURTHER OUT, STARTING TO SEE MAYBE A MARGINAL,\nEMPHASIS ON MARGINAL TICK HIGHER.\nMAX, I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK INTO THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE\nWE ARE SEEING THIS WIDESPREAD RALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE\nGERMAN STOCK MARKET. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS AN ELECTION\nSTANDPOINT AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF SHORT COVERING\nWHEN IT COMES TO THESE CROSS ASSET MOVES? MAXIMILLIAN: YEAH, I THINK IT IS A BIT OF A\nMOVE AFTER THE SETBACK WE SAW LAST WEEK.\nIT IS PRETTY NORMAL BEHAVIOR AHEAD OF ELECTIONS, MORE\nUNCERTAINTY, AND THEN A LITTLE BIT MARKETS DOWN.\nAND THEN AFTER THE ELECTIONS -- IT HAPPENED IN THE U.S.\nAND OTHER PLACES -- I BIT OF RECOVERY.\nI AM NOT SURE THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE SUPER CONSTRUCTIVE\nFOR MARKETS. WITH THINK IT IS BETTER THAN WE\nHAVE SEEN BUT WE HAVE BEEN BULLISH ON MARKETS INTO THE\nEURO. THE TARGET WAS 23,000 FOR DAX\nAND WE ARE ALMOST THERE. A LOT OF THIS POSITIVE\nSENTIMENT IS ALREADY BEING PRICED IN.\nI WOULD SAY ELECTIONS, TODAY&amp;#39;S MOVE IS BECAUSE OF ELECTIONS,\nBECAUSE OF A RELIEF WE DON&amp;#39;T HAVE A THREE PARTY GOVERNMENT.\nBUT I DON&amp;#39;T THINK THE GERMAN ELECTIONS IS A GAME CHANGER.\nPOLITICS IS ONE OF FIVE FACTORS THAT ARE SUPER IMPORTANT FOR\nMARKETS MOVING FORWARD. THIS FACTOR INCREASINGLY BEING\nPRICED IN. KRITI: ONE OF THE EUROPEAN PLAYBOOKS\nWE HAVE SEEN IN TERMS OF SECTOR OUTPERFORMANCE, I WOULD ARGUE\nTHIS IS IN THE STATES AS WELL, FISCAL SPEND IN PARTICULAR\nSECTORS. THE CHIP SECTOR WENT GANGBUSTERS IN THE U.S.\nSIMPLY BECAUSE THEY GOT THE FEDERAL GRANTS.\nWE HAVE SEEN SIMILAR THINGS HAPPEN IN FRANCE, SPAIN AND\nITALY. IS THAT PERHAPS THE EXPECTATION\nTHAT THERE IS THE POLITICS PIECE BUT THE FISCAL SPEND MAY\nBECOMING STRONGLY INTO THE DEFENSE SECTOR OF GERMANY, HOW\nMUCH ROOM DOES THAT HAVE TO GROW? MAXIMILLIAN:\nWE DO THINK THERE WILL BE MORE SPENDING ON DEFENSE.\nWE THINK PART OF GDP, 2.5% SPENDING ON DEFENSE.\nINCREASE IN SPENDING. ON THE OTHER SECTORS, I THINK\nTHERE IS LESS WIGGLE ROOM THAN WE MIGHT HAVE HOPED THAN A WEEK\nAGO BECAUSE THE CENTRIST PARTIES DON&amp;#39;T HAVE A TWO THIRD\nMAJORITY. THAT MEANS THEY CANNOT REALLY\nCHANGE THE DEBT BREAK UNLESS THEY MAKE CONCESSIONS TO THE\nFAR RIGHT OR FAR LEFT. I DON&amp;#39;T THINK AS A RESULT OF\nTHE ELECTIONS WE WILL SEE A LOT MORE FISCAL SPENDING.\nI THINK THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT FROM WHAT.\nWE&amp;#39;VE BEEN WE WILL SEE A LOT MORE SPENDING ON SCHIPS.\nWHAT WE WILL PROBABLY SEE IS A RELIEF ON ENERGY COSTS. IF YOU TAKE OFF THE ENERGY, THE\nTAX THAT IS INCREASING THE ENERGY COST, ABOUT 7% LESS\nENERGY COST, THAT WOULD BE PRETTY POSITIVE.\nFOR ENERGY INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES, I THINK THE THING\n-- THE RESULT WE GOT THIS MORNING IS POSITIVE.\nFOR THE OTHER SECTORS, I DON&amp;#39;T SEE THE BIG IMPACT.\nI THINK WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE CLARITY ONCE WE HAVE A\nCOALITION AGREEMENT. THEN, WE WILL KNOW WHAT THE\nPOLICIES WILL BE ON REAL ESTATE. THE CDU DOES NOT WANT ANY RENT\nCONTROLS. THAT WOULD BE VERY FAVORABLE\nFOR REAL ESTATE. THE SPB IS IN FAVOR OF RENT\nCONTROL. LOOKING OVER ALTHOUGH SECTORSS\nI THINK WE WILL SEVEN WEEKS. FOR NOW, IT IS TOO EARLY TO\nMAKE CONCLUSIONS FROM YESTERDAY&amp;#39;S RESULT ON SECTORS.\nANNA: IF WE BROADEN THE CONVERSATION\nA LITTLE AROUND EUROPEAN STOCKS MORE BROADLY, I CAUGHT UP WITH\nTHE CEO OF PR OSES AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW HE THINGS\nEUROPEAN TECH COMPANIES ARE UNDERVALUED.\nTHE IS MID A BID FOR A PLAY FOR A PLAY FOR EUROPEAN TECH\nCOMPANY THIS MORNING. I WONDER WHETHER M&amp;amp;A, THAT\nLIFTS THE VALUE OF EUROPEAN STOCKS IS SOMETHING YOU ARE\nLOOKING INTO? IS THAT A THEME YOU WILL BE\nPLAYING IN 2025? MAXIMILLIAN: A LOT OF THINGS THAT STILL\nSPEAK IN FAVOR OF EUROPEAN EQUITIES.\nTHEY&amp;#39;VE BEEN OUTPERFORMING 10%. I THINK THEY CAN CONTINUE BUT\nNOT AT THE RATE WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST FEW WEEKS.\nM&amp;amp;A IS ONE OF THE DRIVERS. IF YOU LOOK AT WHY THAT IS\nGOING UP, IT IS BECAUSE VARIATIONS A PRETTY ATTRACTIVE.\nYOU LOOK AT THE VALUATION DIFFERENCES U.S.\nVERSUS EUROPE, THEY ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE ESPECIALLY IF YOU\nCOMPARE THAT TO RATES. WE SEE GREAT EARNINGS MOMENTUM.\n8% BEATS VERSUS EXPECTATION IN EUROPEAN EARNINGS.\nAND ECONOMIC DATA, WE&amp;#39;VE SEEN THAT ON FRIDAY, IS ALSO PRETTY\nSTABLE. WE HAVE BASICALLY FLAT PMI AND\nTHREE POINTS LOWER PMI&amp;#39;S VERSUS EXPECTATIONS.\nTHIS EUROPE VERSUS U.S. PLAY IS STILL WORKING FOR\nEUROPE. I THINK TWO MORE THINGS THAT\nCOULD DRIVE THIS RALLY FURTHER COULD BE A CEASE-FIRE IN\nUKRAINE, THIS ONE WE HAVE VERY LITTLE CERTAINTY.\nAND DON&amp;#39;T FORGET TO WEEKS FROM NOW, WE HAVE THE NPC IN CHINA.\nTHEY WILL BE DISCUSSING POTENTIAL STIMULI FOR THE\nECONOMY. IF THAT IS PERCEIVED AS BEING\nBETTER THAN EXPECTED, THAT WOULD BE A FAVORABLE DRIVER FOR\nEUROPE. YES, M&amp;amp;A IS ONE PART OF THAT\nBUT ONE PART OF MANY POSITIVE DRIVERS FOR EUROPEAN EQUITIES.\nLIZZY: STAYING ON CHINA, OVER THE\nWEEKEND, WE HAD DONALD TRUMP WITH THIS THREAT ON TARIFFS\nWITH BEIJING. WHAT IF CHINA CANNOT SELL INTO\nTHE U.S. AND INSTEAD FLOOD THE EUROPEAN\nMARKET? SURELY, THAT WOULD UNDERCUT\nSOME OF THE EUROPEAN COMPANIES WE ARE WATCHING ON THE STOXX\n600. MAXIMILLIAN: YEAH, THAT IS CERTAINLY A RISK.\nI THINK WE&amp;#39;VE HAD THAT DISCUSSION NOW SINCE DONALD\nTRUMP&amp;#39;S FIRST TERM, RIGHT? EXACTLY THAT.\nMORE TARIFFS WILL MEAN WE WILL HAVE MORE CHINESE IMPORTS INTO\nEUROPE. IT DID NOT HAPPEN AS BAD AS\nPEOPLE EXPECTED. THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A\nTHREAT DRIVING INFLATION LOWER WHICH WOULD BE POSITIVE FOR THE\nRATES DIFFERENTIAL. DRIVING INFLATION LOWER WOULD\nBE MORE CUTS. I&amp;#39;M NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS IS\nA CROSS INDUSTRIES. WE&amp;#39;VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION IN\nTHE OUTER INDUSTRY, BUT IT IS NOT GET A GAME CHANGER FOR\nEARNINGS OR FOR SALES OF EUROPEAN AUTOMAKERS IN EUROPE.\nI&amp;#39;M LESS CONCERNED THAT THE CURRENT MARKET PERCEPTION OF\nTHIS TOPIC. KRITI: WHEN IT COMES TO, ULTIMATELY,\nTHE BULL CASE FOR EUROPE -- I WILL ZOOM THIS OUT -- WHAT IS\nTHE ULTIMATE DRIVING FACTOR? IS IT A TRADE NEGOTIATION WITH\nTHE UNITED STATES? IS IT A TARIFF NEGOTIATION WERE\nOVERCAPACITY STORY WITH CHINA? OR DOES IT STILL COME BACK DOWN\nTO THE DOMESTIC POLITICS? MAXIMILLIAN:\nI THINK DOMESTIC POLITICS IS ONE PART.\nI THINK YOU NEED THREE THINGS FOR U.S.\nINVESTORS TO STEP BACK INTO EUROPE. ONE IS MORE POLITICAL\nSTABILITY. I THINK WE ARE MOVING IN THE\nRIGHT DIRECTION. WE NOW HAVE A BUDGET IN PLACE\nIN FRANCE. WE NOW HAVE A GERMAN GOVERNMENT\nAGAIN. WE DON&amp;#39;T HAVE THE TWO THIRDS\nMAJORITY I WAS HOPING FOR BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE A STABLE\nGOVERNMENT. I THINK THAT GOVERNMENT IS HERE\nTO STAY FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS&amp;#39;S SO THAT SHOULD BE GOOD.\nTHAT APART IS CHECKED. I THINK THOSE CHINESE STIMULI\nWE MENTIONED WOULD BE THE SECOND BIG DRIVER ESPECIALLY\nFROM THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE. I DON&amp;#39;T SEE U.S.\nINVESTORS YET BEING READY TO INVEST IN EUROPE.\nTHE RALLY WE HAVE SEEN IS MOSTLY FROM EUROPEAN INVESTORS.\nFROM THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS\nINTERESTING BECAUSE THE PERCEPTION IS PRETTY DIFFERENT\nON THE CONTINENT VERSUS WHAT WE HEAR FROM U.S. INVESTORS.\nTHE CEASE-FIRE IN UKRAINE FROM A EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE IS\nPERCEIVED AS LESS OF MORTEN, FROM A U.S.\nEFFECTIVE, PRETTY IMPORTANT. THAT SEEMS TO IMPLY LOW\nUNCERTAINTY IN EUROPE. I THINK THOSE ARE THE THREE BIG\nTHINGS. ON TARIFFS, WE&amp;#39;VE BEEN OF THE\nOPINION THEY ARE LESS HURTFUL FOR EUROPE.\nPART OF WHY THE PMI&amp;#39;S LAST WEEK WERE SO NEGATIVE IN THE U.S.\nIS THAT PEOPLE INCREASINGLY REALIZED THAT TARIFFS ARE NOT\nJUST A PROBLEM FOR EUROPE, THEY ARE ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THE U.S.\nIMAGINE YOU ARE A U.S. COMPANY AND YOU NEED TO GET\nYOUR SUPPLIES 25% HIGHER WHICH IS NOT GOOD NEWS IF YOU ARE A\nCONSUMER, IMPORTS ARE GETTING A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE.\nTHAT IS A NEGATIVE FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE OCEAN.\nI THINK MARKETS ARE WAKING UP TO THIS. ANNA: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAXIM\nILLIAN. LET&amp;#39;S GET A CHECK ON SOME OF\nTHE INDIVIDUAL STOCKS ON THE MOVE. JOE EASTON HAS A BRIEFING.\nJOE: A LOT OF ACTION IN THE FOOD DELIVERY STOCKS THIS MORNING,\nPARTICULARLY A LOT OF TRADING COMING THROUGH IN THE PREMARKET\nAUCTION. WE DID HAVE A VOLATILITY HALT\nON THAT ONE, STRUGGLING TO GET A PRICE GIVEN.\nWE ARE EXCITED TO SEE A BIG JUMP.\nTAKE A LOOK AT PROSUS COMING DOWN MORE THAN 7.5%.\nTHEY ALREADY OWN A BIG STEAK IN DELIVERY HERO SO THAT ONE IS\nCOMING UP. THAT WILL FUEL THE PARTNERSHIP\nBETWEEN THEM. WE ARE SEEING DELIVEROO IN\nLONDON. A LOT OF THESE STOCKS BEATEN\nDOWN POST-PANDEMIC. A LOT OF ACTION IN THOSE SHARES\nAND WAITING TO GET A PRICE ON TAKEAWAY AT THE OPEN.\nIN TERMS OF THE OTHER M&amp;amp;A STORY, IT WAS OVER IN ITALY AND\nNORWAY. SAIPEM AND SUBSEA LOOKING TO\nCOMBINE IN AN ALL SHARE TRANSACTION.\nALSO, ITALY HAS A SLICE IN THAT AS WELL.\nWE ARE NOT SEEING A HUGE MOVE. ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES POINTED\nOUT IT IS NOT A MASSIVE PREMIUM ON THAT, BUT WE ARE SEEING A\nMOVE HIGHER ON THOSE STOCKS. IN TERMS OF ELECTRIFICATION,\nTHIS ONE IS VERY INTERESTING. WE ARE SEEING SCHNEIDER\nELECTRIC DROPPING ALMOST 5%. A MASSIVE COMPANY.\nSIEMENS ENERGY, THERE IS A REPORT FROM AN ANALYST SAYING\nTHAT MICROSOFT SEEMS TO BE SCALING BACK ON THEIR DATA\nCENTER INVESTMENT, THEIR CAPEX, AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WEIGHING\nON THE ELECTRIFICATION STOCKS IN EUROPE.\nWE ARE SEEING SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.\nSCHNEIDER ELECTRIC, THE BIGGEST POINTS DECLINER AROUND THAT\nREPORT OF MICROSOFT CAPEX THIS MORNING. ANNA:\nJOE EASTON JOINING US WITH A LOOK AT SOME OF THE STOCKS ON\nTHE MOVE. WE ARE MONITORING THE PRESS\nCONFERENCE THE AFD IS CURRENTLY RUNNING.\nWE&amp;#39;RE LOOKING AT PICTURES OF ONE OF THE COCHAIRS.\nWE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE AFD OTHER CO-CHAIR TALKING\nABOUT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MOVE ON DEBT RULES OR LACK OF IT. REPEATING THE AFD&amp;#39;S OPPOSITION\nINTO LOOSENING DEBT RULES AND REPEATING THE OPPOSITION TO A\nSPECIAL DEFENSE FUND. REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT\nWHAT THE AFD WILL OR WILL NOT VOTE FOR BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY\nOF THE AFD AND LINKE TO FORM SOME BLOCKING MINORITY ON SOME\nIMPORTANT POLICIES AHEAD. WE WILL GET MORE ON GERMANY\nSHORTLY. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. LIZZY:\nLET&amp;#39;S GET BACK TO THE CORPORATE REPORTING.\nSIKA REPORTING FOUR-YEAR YOUR RESULTS THAT MET EXPECTATIONS\nALONGSIDE AN UPBEAT OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR.\nWE ARE JOINED BY THE SEE YOU OVER AT SIKA -- THE CEO OVER AT\nSIKA. LET&amp;#39;S START WITH THE OUTLOOK.\nIT IS GENERALLY ROSY BUT ONE GLOOMY SPOT IS FOR EUROPEAN\nAUTOS WHICH MATTERS FOR GERMANY, A MARKET WE ARE\nTALKING A LOT ABOUT THIS MORNING.\nTALK ME THROUGH WHY YOU BRACED FOR A DIFFICULT YEAR. THOMAS:\nI THINK THE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE NOT CHANGED OVERNIGHT AND THE\nAUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IN EUROPE IS CHALLENGED BY CONFUSION FOR\nTHE FUTURE DIRECTION. TRANSFORMATION TO ELECTRIC IS\nSTALLING, SO WE HAVE A VERY LOW BUILD RATE, LOW CONSUMER\nCONFIDENCE. THAT IS ALSO INDICATING LOW\nVOLUMES IN EUROPE ESPECIALLY. ANNA:\nI KNOW YOU&amp;#39;VE INCREASED YOUR EXPOSURE TO THE GERMAN MARKET\nRECENTLY WITH SOME OF THE M&amp;amp;A YOU&amp;#39;VE BEEN DOING.\nBUYING THE GERMAN BUSINESS. AS A BUSINESS THAT OPERATES IN\nGERMANY AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, IS\nAN IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT YOU GET GOVERNMENT FORMED QUICKLY?\nIS THAT THE KIND OF CERTAINTY THAT BUSINESS IS LOOKING FOR IN\nGERMANY? THOMAS: GERMAN BUSINESSES IS\nSIGNIFICANT, THE THIRD-LARGEST AFTER THE U.S. AND CHINA.\nIT IS THE LOCOMOTIVE OF OUR BUSINESS JUST LIKE EUROPE AS\nWELL. WE HAVE A STRONG ORGANIZATION\nTHAT IS READY BUT WITH THE ELECTION, WE SEE SOME CLARITY\nTHAT HOPEFULLY WILL STIMULATE SO SOME OF THE BACKLOG WILL BE\nRELEASED. LIZZY: YOU ARE SET TO BENEFIT FROM THE\nRECONSTRUCTION OF UKRAINE. HOW ARE YOU PLANNING AHEAD FOR\nTHAT? SUCH A BIG OPPORTUNITY IF WE\nCAN GET PEACE IN THE COUNTRY. THOMAS:\nWE ARE ACTIVE IN UKRAINE. IT IS A SMALL ORGANIZATION\nTHERE. THE BIGGER IMPACT OF PEACE ON\nUKRAINE IS PROBABLY EUROPE ITSELF.\nTHE UNSECURITY THAT IS STILL AROUND. PROBABLY STIMULATE AGAIN,\nCONFIDENCE, THE OUTLOOK WILL BE MORE POSITIVE.\nIT IS MORE IN EUROPE THAN THE UKRAINE. WE ARE ACTIVE.\nDEFINITELY THERE WILL NOT BE MUCH MORE CONSTRUCTION TAKING\nPLACE. ANNA: YOU HAVE A THIRD -- YOU\nMENTIONED GERMANY IS THE THIRD-LARGEST BUSINESS BEHIND\nTHE U.S. AND CHINA. I THINK A THIRD OF YOUR SALES\nCOMES FROM THE AMERICAS AT LEAST. WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATION\nABOUT THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION SECTOR?\nBECAUSE THERE&amp;#39;S A LOT OF PEOPLE EXCITED PERHAPS BY GROWTH BUT\nON THE OTHER HAND, THERE CAN BE TARIFFS PICKING THINGS MORE\nEXPENSIVE. HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AHEAD TO 0\n2025? THOMAS: I JUST CAME BACK FROM VEGAS,\nTHE LARGEST CONSTRUCTION FAIR IN VEGAS.\nTHE ATMOSPHERE IS SUPER POSITIVE.\nTHE INFRASTRUCTURE SPEND IS EXPECTED TO FURTHER RISE.\nI WOULD SAY VERY POSITIVE. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HEAR\nCONSTANTLY, WE HAVE TOO MANY PROJECTS WE CANNOT EXECUTE\nBECAUSE WE ARE MISSING LABOR. THIS IS THE FLIPSIDE THAT\nEVENTUALLY OF WHAT IS ANNOUNCED CANNOT BE PUT IN PLACE BECAUSE\nOF MISSING LABOR. WE HAVE A VERY POSITIVE\nINDUSTRY, AT THE SAME TIME VERY LIMITED AND CHALLENGED INDUSTRY.\nLIZZY: IF YOU ARE IN VEGAS, WILL YOU\nBET MORE ON THE U.S. TO GET AROUND THE TERROR OF\nTHREAT FROM DONALD TRUMP -- TARIFF THREAT FROM DONALD TRUMP?\nTHOMAS: WE&amp;#39;VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT TO\nTHE U.S. THE LAST YEAR AND WE WILL\nCONTINUE. WE HAVE ALMOST AN AUTONOMOUS\nSITUATION. WE PRODUCE IN THE U.S., FOR THE\nU.S.. WE ARE INVESTING INTO GROWTH\nAND THE U.S. MARKET IS GROWING STEADILY.\nWE EXPECT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE FUTURE SO WE ARE GOING TO\nALSO ALLOCATE CAPEX ACCORDING TO THE GROWTH POTENTIAL. ANNA:\nLET ME ASK ABOUT CHINA. THAT IS PERHAPS ONE PART OF THE\nWORLD WE HAVE NOT TOUCHED ON. WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR\nCHINA? WE ARE EXPECTING PERHAPS MORE\nFISCAL BOOSTS IN CHINA WITHIN THE GEOPOLITICS GETS\nCOMPLICATED. THOMAS: CHINA IS COMPLICATED AND WE\nEXPECTED TO BE CHALLENGED THIS YEAR.\nTHIS FISCAL THAT YOU MENTIONED HAS NOT TURNED INTO ACTUALLY\nECONOMICAL CONFIDENCE OF CONSUMERS.\nI THINK THIS IS THE LAGGING FACTOR. THERE&amp;#39;S A LOT OF MONEY. WE HAVE A CONTINUOUS DECREASE\nIN RESIDENTIAL HOUSING PRICES WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF THE\nCONSUMER CONFIDENCE STILL NOT REESTABLISHED.\nTHAT HAS AN IMPACT AND WE ARE A BIT MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT CHINA\nIN THE NEAR TERM. ANNA: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,\nTHOMAS HASLER. WE HAVE SOME MOVEMENT. LIZZY:\nMORE THAN MOVEMENT. SHARES UP 53% FOR JUST EAT, OFF\nTHE BACK OF THE NEWS THAT PROSUS IS TO BUY JUST EAT.\nYOU ARE SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF A GAIN FOR DELIVEROO.\nWHAT A MOVE FOR JUST EAT SHARES THIS MORNING.\nWE WILL GET BACK TO THE GEOPOLITICS.\nTHE EU RAMPING UP SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE AS PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY\nSAYS HE WOULD STEP DOWN IN EXCHANGE FOR PEACE. LIZZY:\nWELCOME BACK TO &amp;quot;THE OPENING TRADE.&amp;quot;\nFTSE SHARES UP 3% THIS MORNING ON THE NEWS THAT ONE COMPANY IS\nGOING TO BUY ANOTHER ON THIS CASH DEAL.\nAS IT PURSUES NEW GROWTH OPPORTUNITY, YOU ARE SEEING A BIT OF A SPILLOVER EFFECT FOR\nTHE LIKES OF A DELIVERY HERO UP THE LIKES OF 2.4 PERCENT, THOSE\nSHARES GAINING OFF THE BACK OF THOSE M&amp;amp;A NEWS, ANNA. ANNA: YES, MARKETS FADING WITH\nOPTIMISM AFTER THE GERMAN ELECTION. LET&amp;#39;S PIVOT OUR THOUGHTS TO\nMORE POLITICS. UKRAINE PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS\nWILLING TO STEP DOWN FOR HIS COUNTRY.\nAHEAD OF THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF RUSSIA&amp;#39;S FULL-SCALE INVASION.\nPRES. ZELENSKYY: IF YOU NEED ME TO GIVE UP MY\nPOST, I&amp;#39;M READY. I&amp;#39;M FOCUSED ON UKRAINE&amp;#39;S\nSECURITY TODAY, NOT IN 20 YEARS. I&amp;#39;M NOT GOING TO BE IN POWER\nFOR DECADES. ANNA: LET&amp;#39;S GET MORE WITH BLOOMBERG&amp;#39;S\nRUSSIA GOVERNMENT EDITOR GREG SULLIVAN.\nWE&amp;#39;VE HEARD FROM VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY COME AS YOU JUST\nHEARD, PLENTY OF U.S. VOICES FAILING TO MENTION\nRUSSIA AS THE AGGRESSOR IN THE WAR IN UKRAINE. IT&amp;#39;S CLEAR THAT TRUMP HAS TAKEN\nA REAL TURN AGAINST UKRAINE. WHERE HAVE WE GOT TO ON THE\nNEGOTIATIONS? I&amp;#39;M NOT SO FOCUSED ON THE\nPOTENTIAL FOR MINERAL DEAL AND WHETHER THAT WILL INCLUDE ANY\nSECURITY GUARANTEES. GREG: ABSOLUTELY.\nIT&amp;#39;S CLEAR THAT ZELENSKYY&amp;#39;S COMMENTS ARE A RESPONSE TO\nTRUMP LABELING HIM A DICTATOR AND THE PRESSURES THEY ARE\nPUTTING ON HIM. BUT THEY DO POINT TO A\nFUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT WILL BE A STICKING POINT TO ANY\nNEGOTIATIONS, THE SECURITY GUARANTEES THAT ARE NEEDED TO\nSTOP THE FIGHTING AND KEEP IT STOPPED.\nZELENSKYY HIMSELF SAID THAT WOULD BE NATO MEMBERSHIP IN\nTHESE COMMENTS. BUT RUSSIA HAS RULED OUT NATO\nTROOPS ON UKRAINIAN LAND. THE U.S.\nHAS RULED OUT PUTTING BOOTS ON THE GROUND.\nTHAT REALLY LEAVES A BIG ISSUE HERE, WHICH IS HOW DOES UKRAINE\nDETER RUSSIA AND WHAT KIND OF VIABLE SECURITY GUARANTEE IS\nGOING TO COME, AND RIGHT NOW, THAT IS JUST NOT CLEAR. KRITI:\nTHERE IS TALK, AT LEAST IN SOME OF THE MAJOR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES\nWHO DO HAVE A MORE MILITARY CAPABILITY, LIKE U.K., FRANCE,\nGERMANY, FOR EXAMPLE, OF TALKS AS A REASSURANCE FORCE.\nTALKS IN D.C. THIS WEEK WITH EMMANUEL MACRON\nAND KEIR STARMER AS WELL. IS THAT ENOUGH FOR EUROPE TO\nGET ITSELF OFF THE SIDELINES? GREG: THAT IS THE REAL QUESTION.\nWE&amp;#39;VE SEEN EUROPE REALLY RUSHING TO TRY TO COORDINATE A\nRESPONSE AND TRY TO GET THEMSELVES TOGETHER.\nAS YOU SAID, THERE ARE NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT A\nREASSURANCE FORCE, ALSO A DEFENSE PACKAGE TO PROVIDE A ID\nTO KYIV. THE TIMELINE IS UNCERTAIN FOR\nTHAT. WE DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING TO\nDISCUSS. THEY ARE TRYING TO STEP UP AND\nPROVIDE THAT, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR IF EUROPE ALONE COULD FILL THE\nGAP SHOULD THE U.S. PULLBACK, BUT, AGAIN, THAT IS A\nMAJOR ISSUE ON HOW ANY RESOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT\nCOMES TO BE. LIZZY: MEANWHILE, WHAT COMES NEXT FOR\nTHE U.S.-RUSSIA TALKS, GREG? GREG: THAT IS ALSO INTERESTING.\nOVER THE WEEKEND, WE SOLVE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR\nPUTIN APPOINTED THE HEAD OF THE RUSSIAN SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND\nFOR A NEGOTIATOR. HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE FIRST\nROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS IN RIYADH, BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT\nPOLLUTION IS APPOINTING A BUSINESSMAN ENVOY TO MEET TRUMP\nPOSE A BUSINESSMAN ENVOY. THE TWO SIDES ARE COMING UP\nWITH A WAY TO HOLD MORE TALKS BETWEEN OFFICIALS.\nIF TRUMP STILL WANTS THAT LEADERS SUMMIT, BUT IT IS NOT\nNECESSARILY IN PUTIN&amp;#39;S INTEREST AS HE MAKES BATTLEFIELD GAMES.\nTHAT&amp;#39;S THE NEXT QUESTION IS IF AND WHEN A POTENTIAL LEADER\nSUMMIT COULD BE. LIZZY: OK, GREG SULLIVAN, BLOOMBERG&amp;#39;S\nOF RUSSIA GOVERNMENT EDITOR. I WANT TO CONTINUE THIS\nCONVERSATION NOW. THE EUROPEAN UNION RUSHING THE\nBLOCK WILL HOLD A SUMMIT ON MARCH 6 FOLLOWING AN ABOUT TURN\nTHAT GREG WAS TALKING ABOUT. LET&amp;#39;S TALK TO A RESEARCH\nASSOCIATE TO DEFENSE ON MILITARY ANALYSIS AT THE\nINTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES.\nREALLY GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US, ESTHER.\nDO YOU SEE THEM SUPPLANTING NATO IN TIME? ESTTER:\nTHIS IS A QUESTION THAT FREES UP OTHER COMPANIES. I WOULD SAY THERE NEEDS TO BE A\nCLEAR PERCEPTION BUT THEY NOW HAVE TO ACT.\nBUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE RULE CHANGING COME OF RESOURCES TO\nTHAT, THAT IS STILL PROBLEMATIC. FOR THE LAST YEAR, NATO EU\nMEMBERS ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY ONE-THIRD OF EXPENSES, OF\nCOURSE, AT THE NATO LEVEL. SO, OF COURSE, THAT ALREADY\nREPLIES TO YOUR QUESTION ON HOW MUCH EUROPEANS CAN SPEED UP AND\nREALLY BE AT THE LEVEL NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE\nDEFENSE FOR EUROPE. LIZZY: SUPPOSE AS WE FACTOR IN THE AFD\nPERFORMANCE IN THE GERMAN ELECTION OVERNIGHT, IF YOU ARE\nGOING TO INTEGRATE EUROPEAN DEFENSE, HOW DO YOU PREVENT\nWHAT IS HAPPENING IN NATO HAPPENING TO THIS EUROPEAN\nALLIANCE? ONE U.S. ELECTION HAS UPENDED THE\nWORLD&amp;#39;S ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT DEFENSE. ANOTHER GERMAN ELECTION, FOR\nEXAMPLE, COULD DO EXACTLY THE SAME. ESTER: WE DON&amp;#39;T SEE HOW THE COALITION\nGOVERNMENT WILL BE FORMED, BUT WHAT WE CAN REALLY SEE IS THAT\nGERMANY HAS ANNOUNCED IT IS REALLY A DIFFERENT MINEFIELD,\nFURTHER STRENGTH TOWARD THE EUROPEAN PROJECTS, AND\nPARTICULARLY TO STRENGTHEN DEFENSE. WE CAN ALSO SEE THIS IS\nPARTICULARLY IN LINE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE.\nWHAT WILL NEED TO BE DONE, I WOULD SAY, IS TO FIND TWO\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF AGREEMENT. ON THE ONE HAND, YOU WILL NEED\nTO REALLY TRY TO FIND THE POLITICAL WILL TO EVENTUALLY\nALSO FIND THE RIGHT ARCHITECTURE FOR THE EUROPEANS\nTO INTERVENE AND TO PROVIDE THE SECURITY BEING TALKED ABOUT\nTHIS IN THE NEXT DAYS, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU WILL ALSO\nNEED TO FIND THE PROPER WAY TO PRODUCE TOGETHER WHAT EUROPEAN\nCOUNTRIES ARE MISSING. THE ROW WILL BE THE STRUCTURE\nIS AVAILABLE AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL, WHAT HAS BEEN MISSING SO\nFAR IS THE WILLINGNESS TO REALLY ACT TO INCREASE DEFENSE\nCAPABILITIES. SO IT IS NOT JUST SOMETHING\nTHAT IS DEPENDENT ON GERMANY, I WOULD SAY, BUT, OF COURSE, YOU\nWILL NEED TO HAVE AN AGREEMENT OF THE 27.\nTHIS IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF THE EUROPEAN UNION WHEN IT\nCOMES TO DEFENSE, BECAUSE, OF COURSE, IT IS THEIR COMBINATION\nOF THE 27 MEMBERS, THE WILLINGNESS OF 27 MEMBER STATES.\nSO ACTUALLY WHAT COULD HAPPEN, WHAT COULD ALSO SPEED UP THE\nPROCESS WOULD BE TO HAVE COALITIONS OF THE WILLING\nINSIDE THE EU OR GROUPS OF COUNTRIES TO ACT FASTER IN\nEUROPE TO IMPROVE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.\nAND TO THINK ABOUT THIS KIND OF GAP COME THE COUNTRIES THAT I\nWOULD SAY WOULD NEED TO BE THERE WOULD BE FOR SURE FRANCE,\nGERMANY, ITALY, SPAIN, YOU KNOW, REALLY THE COUNTRIES THAT\nHAVE BEEN PROMOTING DEFENSE BUT AUTONOMY, ALSO POLAND IN THIS YE\nREGARDED AS RELEVANT, AS WE SAW IN THE LAST YEAR THAT\nPOLAND REALLY INCREASED DEFENSE SPENDING. ANNA: ESTER, CAN I ASK YOU, FROM A\nDEFENSE PERSPECTIVE, THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE TAKING\nPLACE AROUND UKRAINE? THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION IS OFFERING WHAT\nIT IS CALLING ECONOMIC SECURITY GUARANTEES, INSTEAD OF SOME\nKIND OF MILITARY GUARANTEE. I WONDER IF THE TWO CAN GET TO\nTHE SAME PAGE. DO YOU SEE ANY WAY THAT THE\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION COMING WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BUSINESS\nDEAL AND THE UKRAINIANS WANTING SECURITY GUARANTEES?\nCAN THEY FIND COMMON GROUND? ESTER:\nTHERE ARE FINDING SECURITY GUARANTEES FROM EUROPEAN\nCOUNTRIES, YOU REALLY SAW THE REACTION FROM\nRUSSIANS, WHERE THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT ANY PRESENCE\nOF NATO MEMBERS TO HAVE THESE GUARANTEES.\nSO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC. AND WE ALSO SAY THAT HAVING\nSECURITY GUARANTEES THAT IS DISCONNECTED BY, DISCONNECTED\nFROM THE ECONOMIC AGREEMENT AS WELL AS FROM THE SUPPORT OF THE\nU.S., NOT TO PROVIDE THIS CERTAIN GUARANTEE THAT UKRAINE\nIS LOOKING FOR. KRITI:\nESTER, TALK TO US ABOUT THEM NOT ONLY THE SECURITY GUARANTEE\nAND UKRAINE, BUT THIS IS COMING AT THE SAME TIME THAT DONALD\nTRUMP TALKING ABOUT REMOVING MILITARY PRESENCE, AND AMERICAN\nMILITARY PRESENCE, SPECIFICALLY RIGHT HERE IN GERMANY.\nHOW DOES THAT SQUARE WITH THE ECONOMIC INTEREST IN UKRAINE?\nCAN THEY BOTH EXIST, OR IS IT ONE OR THE OTHER? ESTER:\nTHIS IS A COMPLEX QUESTION TO ANSWER. SO WE ALSO SAW OVER THE\nWEEKEND&amp;#39;S EVENTS THERE WERE SOME REASSURANCES ON THE\nPRESENCE OF U.S. ON POLAND TERRITORIES, AND\nTHAT, OF COURSE, MEANS THAT TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO LEAVE\n100% OF EUROPEAN SOIL. SO THERE WILL BE A SORT OF\nGUARANTEE. OF COURSE, THE FARTHER WEST THE\nGUARANTEES ARE, THE WORST COME IN A WAY, TO ENSURE THE\nSECURITY GUARANTEE IS FOR UKRAINE, BUT I THINK THAT IS\nNOW THE CENTRAL OF THE DISCUSSION AND THE NEGOTIATIONS\nWOULD NEED TO BE EXACTLY ON FINDING WAYS TO ENSURE ACTUALLY\nNOT FINDING EUROPEANS BUT ALSO THE U.S.\nIN A WAY THAT WE NEGOTIATED AND AGREE UPON WILL BE PRESENT,\nSECURITY GUARANTEES COME APART FROM ECONOMIC SUPPORT. KRITI: ESTER SABATINO, RESEARCH\nANALYST AT THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR STRATEGIC STUDIES.\nWE THANK YOU FOR BREAKING DOWN POLICIES.\nAS WE WERE SPEAKING TO ESTER, WE SAW THE DAX COMPLETELY TEAR\nITS OPENING GAINS. IT HAD OPENED OVER 1%, SOME\nTHINKING A LITTLE BIT OF AN ELECTION RISK RALLY.\nWE NOW SEE IT FLAT. YOU ARE SEEING QUITE A BIT OF\nMOVEMENT IN THE DEFENSE SECTOR. THAT IS THE PART OF THE MARKET\nTHAT IS CONTINUING TO RALLY RIGHT ALONG SIDE OF THE AUTO\nSECTOR AS WELL. DOESN&amp;#39;T CHANGE THE GAME AS FAR\nAS POLICY THERE? WHERE WE SEE IT IS SAP,\nDEUTSCHE BANK, ADIDAS, SOME CONSUMER FACING STOCKS,\nCONSUMER STOCKS, THE IDEA THAT YOU SEE VOLKSWAGEN, MERCEDES,\nBMW, PORSCHE, THEY ARE CONTINUING TO DECLINE.\nI WONDER HOW MUCH OF THAT IS REALLY A FUNCTION OF POLICY\nEXPECTATIONS AND FISCAL SPENT COMING OUT OF THIS NEW GERMAN\nGOVERNMENT? COMING UP ON THE PROGRAM, WE\nARE GOING TO DIVE INTO MORE OF THAT COVERAGE AND THE ELECTION\nIMPACT. STICK WITH US FOR THAT CONVERSATION. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.\n &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT\nINCREASING THE AMOUNT OF INSTRUMENTS WE HAVE TOGETHER.\nWE ALREADY HAVE QUITE A FEW, AND WE HAVE BEEN OPEN TO\nINCREASING THOSE, ABOUT WHAT WE DON&amp;#39;T SUPPORT IS JUST TOO FLAT\nOUT SAY WE ARE GOING TO NEUTRALIZE DEBT TO FINANCE\nSOMETHING THAT IS NOT DEFINED OR SOMETHING THAT\nDECISION-MAKING STAYS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, BUT FINANCING\nAT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL, THAT JUST CREATES ASYMMETRY THAT\nDOES NOT MAKE ECONOMIC OR MILITARY SENSE. KRITI: GERMANY&amp;#39;S FINANCE MINISTER JÖRG\nKUKIES SPEAKING TO ME ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT GERMANY WANTS TO\nBE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DEFENSE SPENDING.\nTHE IMMEDIATE IDEA WAS THIS IS HOW YOU RAISE FUNDS FOR A LOT\nOF THE EUROPEAN UNION SO THAT THEY AS A HOLD INVEST IN\nDEFENSE. -- AS A WHOLE INVEST IN DEFENSE.\nIF GERMANY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO IT, WHY SHOULD THE FUNDING NOT\nBE ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL, AT THE LEVEL OF EU?\nSO HE&amp;#39;S VOUCHING FOR THE IDEA OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT CAN\nTHEN BE FUNDED BY INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENTS.\nTHAT IS HIS ARGUMENT, BUT CRITICS OF THAT WOULD SAY\nGERMANY IS ALWAYS SLOW TO COME TO THE TABLE WHEN IT COMES TO\nTHESE COALITION MOVES, NOT JUST DOMESTICALLY BUT\nINTERNATIONALLY AS WELL COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED IN THE\n1990&amp;#39;S WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE EURO.\nGERMANY WAS SLOW TO ADOPT FOR THESE VERY SAME CONCERNS.\nWHY SHOULD ONE COUNTRY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WHOLE?\nTHIS IS ALSO COMING, OF COURSE, IN THE CONTEXT OF GERMANY AND\nFRIEDRICH MARKS, THE PARTY LEADER, DO TO BE THE NEXT\nCHANCELLOR OF GERMANY, IS LOOKING TO INVEST AND MODERNIZE\nTHE MILITARY WHILE CUTTING THE MORE DOMESTIC CUTS AROUND\nIMMIGRATION AND, OF COURSE, SOME OF THE PRESSURES AS WELL.\nA LOT GOING ON, BOTH INTRINSICALLY AND EXTERNALLY. LET&amp;#39;S BRING IN DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER AND A BOARD\nMEMBER, A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU ON THIS PROGRAM.\nWE ARE DEALING WITH A LOT OF NEWS FLOW AND AGENDA ITEMS WHEN\nIT COMES TO WHAT THIS NEW GERMAN GOVERNMENT WANTS TO\nACCOMPLISH. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO\nBE THE EASIEST THING FOR THEM TO CHECK OFF THIS LAUNDRY LIST? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOOD MORNING. I THINK THERE IS NO EASY CHECK\nOF THE LIST. WE ARE NOW LOOKING FOR THE NEXT STEP THAT WOULD BE\nHOW TO FORM A COALITION THAT CAN ACTUALLY GOVERN, TO COME TO THIS QUICKLY, AND WE ARE AT\nDIVERSION POINTS, WHICH IS ACTUALLY ONLY POLITICALLY\nVIABLE POSITION AT THIS MOMENT. THE ECONOMY WOULD BE THE TOP\nPICK. I&amp;#39;M HOPING THAT AT LEAST ON\nDEFENSE, THERE WILL BE A QUICK CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE TWO\nPARTIES, PERHAPS EVEN BEFORE THE POSITION COMES INTO PLAY,\nBECAUSE THIS IS THE MOST URGENT TOPIC THAT NEEDS TO BE\nDISCUSSED. ANNA: DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A\nQUICK CONSENSUS? GOOD TO SEE YOU.\nTHANKS FOR JOINING US. WHAT ABOUT THE VIEW OF THE AFD\nAND THE FACT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON\nDEFENSE, A REFORM OF THE DEBT BREAK, IF THEY THOUGHT IT WAS\nGOING TO BE USED FOR DEFENSE SPENDING? DR. NGUYEN:\nINDEED, THIS IS ONE OF THE PRESENT QUESTIONS, THE WAY\nPARLIAMENT IS EXECUTED. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MAJORITY,\nWHICH LIMITS THE DEFENSE SPENDING. NOW THEY LEFT PARTY TO CARRY\nTHIS IS THE OPEN QUESTION. THE LEFT IS IN FAVOR FOR MORE\nINVESTMENTS, MORE INVESTMENTS IN INCOME STRUCTURE, CLIMATE\nAND SOCIAL POLICIES. SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING\nTHAT WOULD BE A TASK FOR THE NEXT CHANCELLOR, WHO IS MOST\nLIKELY FRIEDRICH MERZ. LIZZY: I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK POLICY\nIN EUROPE WILL LOOK LIKE UNDER A CHANCELLOR FRIEDRICH MERTZ,\nAND WHETHER HE WILL PLAY A ROLE OF EUROPE. DR. NGUYEN:\nTHIS IS MORE OF THE EXPECTATIONS, AND EUROPE IS\nFACING CHALLENGERS, AND THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT OUTSPENT IN POLICY, AND\nFRIEDRICH MERZ HAS A ROLE, THE RESPONSE BY EUROPE TO THE\nRUSSIAN THREAT BUT ALSO TO THE POLICY SHIFTS IN THE U.S.\nAND, AGAIN, I THINK A LOT OF THIS WOULD HAVE DEPENDED ON\nWHETHER HE WILL HAVE THE POLICY FOR THE GOVERNMENT. THIS WILL ALLOW HIM TO HAVE A\nTWO-PARTY COALITION, OR THREE PARTY, IF YOU TAKE THAT VIEW.\nHE WANTS TO TAKE ON INVESTORS. EVERYONE IS EXPECTING HIM TO\nTAKE ON. KRITI: LET&amp;#39;S CIRCLE AROUND TO THE\nINTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF THIS. HOW DOES FRIEDRICH MERZ&amp;#39;S\nPOLICY AGENDA SQUARE ON THE INTERNATIONAL FRONT WITH THE\nLIKES OF URSULA VON DER LEYEN, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE\nTHE SAME ROUTES IN GERMANY? WHERE ARE THE STICKY POISON\nTHAT RELATIONSHIP? DR. NGUYEN: YEAH.\nSO THE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS IS YOU CAN KEEP ITS PARTY,\nTHE SAME PARTY OF THE PRESIDENT. HE&amp;#39;S ALSO THE BIGGEST\nPARLIAMENT , SO IT IS IN THESE INSTITUTIONS. HE SAID HE WILL WANT TO USE THE\nMAJORITY TO PUSH FORWARD INTEGRATION. HE HAS BEEN VERY VOCAL OR\nINFLUENTIAL ON SEGMENTS GENERALLY. THE QUESTION IS IN HOW FAR\nIT WILL GO FOR FRIEDRICH MERZ, BECAUSE THERE IS, OF COURSE, A\nDIFFERENCE IN HOW THEY SEE CLIMATE.\nONE OF THE FLAGSHIP PROJECTS FOR URSULA VON DER LEYEN IN HER\nPREVIOUS TERM THAT WOULD VERY MUCH DEPEND ON THE NECESSITY TO\nPUT THE POLICY FOR CLIMATE. ONCE TO DEREGULATE A LOT OF THE\nREGULATION, TO ROLL BACK, AND I THINK THIS MIGHT BE AN ISSUE\nWHERE THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENCES IN OPINION BETWEEN\nTHE TWO. ANNA: OK. I WONDER, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES\nOF OPINION IN GERMANY, BUT I WONDER IF THIS CENTER-RIGHT LED\nGOVERNMENT TAKES GERMANY A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE UNITED\nSTATES. I SAW PRESIDENT TRUMP\nCONGRATULATING FRIEDRICH MERZ. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT FOR THE\nU.S.-GERMAN RELATIONSHIP? DR. NGUYEN:\nFRIEDRICH MERZ HAS COME AFTER THE ELECTION, BEEN QUITE CLEAR ON THE NEED FOR THE NEED TO\nBECOME MORE INDEPENDENT FROM THE U.S. THE SPEECH BY VICE PRESIDENT\nVANCE MIGHT SUPPORT THE AFD AND MIGHT HELP THEM IN THE ELECTION.\nTHIS WE HAVE NOT SEEN SO MUCH. THE POLLS HAVE BEEN QUITE\nSTEADY. OTHERWISE, I THINK WHAT IS VERY\nCLEAR IS THAT WE WILL HAVE A CENTRIST GOVERNMENT IN GERMANY. AND IT IS NOW LOOKING TO GO\nINTO TALKS WITH THE CENTRIST COALITION, AND I THINK THIS IS\nA VERY GOOD OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION THAT THIS IS GOING TO\nHAVE. ANNA: OK, THU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,\nTHU NG UYEN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND\nSENIOR POLICY FELLOW FOR EU INSTITUTIONS AND DEMOCRACY AT\nTHE JACQUES DELORS CENTRE. WHAT ARE WE SEEING IN STOCKS?\nKRITI: A LOT OF VOLATILITY. WE SEE ALL OF THOSE GAINS\nCOMPLETELY PAIRED THIS MORNING, BUT I THINK THAT IT WAS THAT WE\nSEE OUTPERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OTHER INDEXES, YOU SEE ON YOUR\nSCREEN RIGHT NOW, THE AUTO SECTOR AND DEFENSE SECTOR VERY\nMUCH DRIVING WHAT LITTLE RALLY THERE IS MUCH HIGHER.\nTHE AUTO SECTOR CERTAINLY ON YOUR SCREEN THERE.\nTHE DEFENSE SECTOR GETTING A LOT OF LOVE THIS MORNING ON THE\nEXPECTATION THAT IS GOING TO BE WHERE WE WILL SEE A LOT OF THE\nSPENDING PUSHES WELL. -- PUSH AS WELL.\nWE WILL BE SEEING THIS IDEA OF A DEBT BREAK OR NOT.\nAND OF COURSE THE EURO STRENGTHENING TO A 1.05 HANDLE.\nCOMING UP, WE WILL HAVE A"

      "captions": "&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOOD MONDAY MORNING, YOU&amp;#39;RE\nWATCHING THE CHINA SHOW WITH DAVID AND REBECCA. REBECCA: THE EURO IS HIGHER IN THE FAR\nRIGHT AFD COMING IN SECOND. WHAT THE OUTCOME MEANS. DAVID: THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE SET TO\nIMPOSE TARIFFS ON CHINESE IMPORTS. REBECCA: NEW WORLD FLAGS A LOSS OF 875\nMILLION DOLLARS, A SLUMP. DAVID: SPECIAL COVERAGE OF DRONES AND\nTHEIR ROLE IN WARFARE. WE ARE LOOKING AT A DOWNDRAFT,\nJAPAN IS SHUT FOR THE EMPEROR&amp;#39;S BIRTHDAY. NO CASH MARKET TRADING GOING\nINTO PCE WEEK -- FLIP THE BOARDS PLEASE. BOND FUTURES AND A SENSE OF THE\nTWO-YEAR SHORTLY. STOCKS UP. THE GERMAN BUND IS DOWN ABOUT\n10 POINTS. WORLD BEATING RALLY CONTINUED PAST TENSE,\nSIMILAR NAMES IN HONG KONG WE WILL BE TRACKING THAT INFLOWS. ALMOST BACK TO THE PEAK. SO WE ARE STARTING WITH SOME\nWEAKNESS. DOLLAR CHINA AT 725. REBECCA: THE BIG STORIES IN TERMS OF THE AGENDA WE HAVE THE BOND SALE,\nSTARTING TO STAMMER AND STUTTER. ANOTHER STORY, WE HAD A HEFTY CHUNK OF LOSSES, THE PLAN INTENDED TO PAY OFF DEBT LAST\nYEAR, THIS YEAR, NEXT YEAR. DAVID: YEAH, UH, SOME BREAKING NEWS IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, S GX SHARES WERE UP 8.5% HERE TODAY, IT IS\nBUSY, IT HAS BEEN BUSY. LET&amp;#39;S BRING IN ALL OVER -- O\nLVIER CROOK. GET US UP TO SPEED. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE GOT A FINAL CERTIFICATION,\nWE GOT SOMETHING IN LINE WITH THE POLLING, THE TRADITIONAL PARTY IS NUMBER ONE AT 28.6,\nBELOW THE AVERAGE AND THE OTHER GREAT FEATURE WAS THE FAR RIGHT\nAFD PUTTING UP THEIR FIRST CHANCELLOR CANDIDATE AND WE SAW\nOLAF SCHOLZ PARTY WITH THE WORST OUTCOME, A REAL BLOW TO\nTHE CHANCELLOR BUT I SPENT THE EVENING TRYING TO UNDERSTAND\nPRIORITIES. LISTEN TO WHAT A SENIOR\nLAWMAKER HAD TO SAY. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE A CLEAR MANDATE THAT\nOLAF SCHOLZ IS DONE AND WE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE COURSE OF GERMANY.\nWE WILL MEET OUR NEEDS SO IT IS A CLEAR MANDATE. DAVID:\nFREDERICK SETS UP AT A TIME WHEN WE&amp;#39;VE HAD TWO YEARS OF\nCONTRACTION, POTENTIALLY A THIRD WITH A LEADERSHIP VACUUM AND WILL THE CHANCELLOR STEP\nUP, LOOSEN THE DEBT BREAK? COULD HE TAKE ON ISSUES CENTER\nDOT THE WHITE HOUSE? REBECCA:\nEVERY TWIST AND TURN OF THE GERMANY ELECTION, WE WILL GET\nMORE LATER ON. ALLIE ENDS -- ALLIANZ AND THE\nCHAMBER OF COMMERCE COMING UP. DAVID:\nTRUMP IS PLACING TARIFFS TO AVOID THREATENING DUTIES IN THE\nUNITED STATES. LET&amp;#39;S BRING IN STEPHEN ENGLE. STEPHEN: WE HAD SCOTT BESSENT ON A PHONE\nCALL WITH THE VICE PREMIER TRADING BARBS WITH SERIOUS\nTRADE POLICY CONCERNS, IT DID NOT SET THE TONE WELL AND WE\nHAD COMMERCE BLASTING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ABOUT MEXICO, NEITHER SIDE\nCONFIRMED IN MEXICAN TRADE VISIT TO WASHINGTON DC BUT HOWARD LUTNICK AND KEVIN HASSETT MET WITH A\nMEXICAN DELEGATION, TELLING THEM THEY SHOULD APPLY TARIFFS ON IMPORTS IN ORDER TO\nALLEVIATE THE 25% TARIFF THREAT. THE THREAT GOT A ONE-MONTH\nMONTH REPRIEVE UNTIL MARCH 1, SO THIS COULD BE A BUSY WEEK OF BARGAINING AND PHONE CALLS WITH\nCANADA, BUT CHINA IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME. DAVID:\nTHANK YOU. STEPHEN ENGLE THERE OF COURSE\nAND IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES LIVE OUT OF SHANGHAI FOR MORE ON THE\nGROUND NEWS. SEE GBA&amp;#39;S 3.5 TO THE UPSIDE, UP\nBY ONE POINT FIVE AND WEAKNESS CONTINUES, WATCHING IT CLOSELY.\nCOMING DOWN TO THE OPENING OF TRADE, YOU ARE WATCHING THE\nCHINA SHOW. DAVID: YOU ARE WATCHING THE CHINA SHOW , IT IS FAIRLY CLEAR IN THE EURO IS A BID, BOND FUTURES ARE\nTO BE UPSIDE. LET&amp;#39;S GET OUR THOUGHTS ON THIS,\nLET&amp;#39;S BRING IN THE GLOBAL CIO FOR ALLIANZ INVESTORS.\nTHANK YOU FOR SPEAKING WITH US, VIRGINIA.\nLET&amp;#39;S START WITH EUROPE, THEY DID WELL, JUST YOUR THOUGHTS? VIRGINIA:\nEUROPE WAS SELLING AT A HUGE DISCOUNT AND U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM LED TO\nHIGH VALUATIONS SUPPORTED BY UKRAINE RUSSIA PEACE AGREEMENT\nAND ELECTIONS IN GERMANY AND FRANCE, THOSE COUNTRIES ARE PILLARS OF EUROPE WITH\nVOLATILITY IN THE PAST YEAR. DAVID:\nWHAT IS DRIVING UP EQUITIES? VIRGINIA: VALUATIONS IS ONE OF THE, VERY\nIMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF THE SHIFTING WORLD ORDER THAT THE\nPERSPECTIVE ON SPENDING, DEBT TO GDP IS 65% AND SPENDING AND THE PEACE DIVIDEND LED TO\nSOME HOPE IN THE STOCK MARKET. REBECCA:\nCHINESE EQUITIES IN THIS GLOBAL CONTEXT, CHINA&amp;#39;S DISCOUNT\nEXCLUDES THE U.S. AND NORMALIZES THE AVERAGE, 80%\nDISCOUNT COMPARED TO PRE-PANDEMIC TREND, IS THIS\nGOING TO PERSIST AND DOES IT MATTER? VIRGINIA: ABSOLUTELY, I JUST CAME FROM\nSHANGHAI AND ON A GLOBAL BASIS THE MARKET IS CHEAP , PEOPLE\nHAVE NOT BELIEVED IN CHINESE INNOVATION BUT YOU PUT THIS\nTOGETHER WITH THE DEEP MARKET THAT CAN BE THE TECH MARKET IF\nYOU WANT, MEANS THERE WILL BE MORE INTERESTS. IF YOU GO BACK TO 2023 THAT IS\nCREATING A LOT OF TENSION. DAVID:\nUM, I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHETHER THE RALLY ATTRACTED --\nI WONDER -- WONDER OF -- OF -- OF -- OF NEW FUNDS IN CHINA,\nWEATHERED THE PATIENT INVESTOR IS PARTICIPATING IN -- IN -- IN\n-- IN -- IN THIS CURRENT RALLY? VIRGINIA:\nYOU STILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR DEDICATED MONEY TO CHINA\nAND INDIA FOR DIFFERENT REASONS IF YOU WANT, BUT YOU WILL SEE\nALLOCATION INTO CHINA IN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, BUT\nTARIFF DISCUSSIONS, BETWEEN XI JINPING AND PRESIDENT TRUMP,\nTHEY WILL CREATE VOLATILITY. WE HAVE INTERESTING SUPPORT\nMEASURE FOR THE CONSUMER WHICH IS WHAT CHINA NEEDS,\nSTABILIZING PROPERTY MARKET, TRADE WILL NOT BE AS STRONG.\nFOR THE CONSUMER IT IS IMPORTANT. DAVID: YOU MENTIONED INDIA WHICH HAS\nSEEN A PULLBACK. WHAT MARKETS DO YOU SEE WITH\nOUTFLOWS? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE REALLOCATION MIGHT BE A GLOBAL BASIS AND YOU&amp;#39;VE HAD\nINDIA ALLOCATION, BENEFITING FROM THE CHINA PLUS ONE\nSTRATEGY , BUILDING NEW FACTORIES TO DIVERSIFY THE\nSUPPLY CHAIN AS WE ARE SEEING, ALTHOUGH THE MARKET IS NOT CHEAP IS ATTRACTIVE AND WE\nARE SEEING NEW COMPANIES THAT WE LIKE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRUMP FACTOR INDIA IS NEUTRAL AND GOING TO SEE A LOT OF\nBENEFITS THE SAME WAY WE HAD THIS HAPPENING IN CHINA AND\nIT&amp;#39;S A REASON TO GAIN EXPOSURE. REBECCA:\nI WANT TO PICK UP ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHINESE\nCONSUMER, IS IT CHANGING WHAT INVESTORS NEED TO SEE? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SUPPORTING MEASURES AS YOU\nKNOW DEMOGRAPHICS ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF CHINA AND PEOPLE ARE\nSAVING RETIREMENT BENEFITS, IT IS ABOUT BRINGING THE\nCONFIDENCE BACK FOR THE CONSUMER TO SPEND SO IF WE HAD\nMEASURES SUPPORTING RETIREMENT FOR TAX BENEFITS IT IS NOT THAT\nPEOPLE DON&amp;#39;T WANT TO SPEND. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE\nFUTURE AND WE HAVE HAD SENIOR LEADERS MENTIONING CONSUMER\nIMPORTANCE, THAT IS WHERE WE ARE LOOKING FOR MEASURES\nULTIMATELY, WE NEED PENSION REFORM GIVEN THE POPULATION\nAGING. REBECCA:\n1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF GDP WAS FROM EXPORTS. IS IT YOUR ASSUMPTION THAT TARIFFS WILL CAUSE BEIJING TO\nUSE FD STIMULUS OR IS THERE PAIN THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO\nTOLERATE? VIRGINIA: WE WILL GET A TARGET OF 5%, THE\nNET RATE CONTRIBUTION WILL BE LOWER BECAUSE OF TARIFFS\nAND WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHERE TARIFFS ARE GOING. SO FAR TARIFFS OF 10% HAVE BEEN\nLOW VERSUS THE RHETORIC DURING THE CAMPAIGN. THIS IS BECAUSE DISCUSSIONS ARE\nHAPPENING AROUND THE RUSSIAN ISSUE AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING\nTHAT COULD BE FLUID AND WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BUT TARIFFS, THE\nIMPACT WILL NOT BE AS MUCH SO THE CATCHING UP FROM THE CONSUMER WILL NOT BE AS HIGH\nBUT WE NEED THE CONSUMER TO STEP UP. DAVID: FINAL QUESTION, IF U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM IS UNDER THREAT\nWHAT HAPPENED TO THE MARKET IN TAIWAN? VIRGINIA: DIGITAL DARWINISM, COMPETITIVE\nFORCES REMAINS INTACT AND TAIWAN IS IN PLAY SO\nTRANSFORMING, TAIWAN IS CRITICAL TO THAT SO WE LIKE\nTAIWAN VERY MUCH. IT IS A GOOD COMPANY TO HAVE.\nDAVID: THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHTS. VIRGINIA, WE&amp;#39;RE GOING INTO THE\nOPENING FLAT, PLENTY MORE AHEAD. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. DAVID: WE ARE UP FOR SIX STRAIGHT WEEKS, HANG SENG HAVE BEEN AT THE TOP, WEAKNESS PERMEATING IN THE EQUITY MARKET SO THAT PUSHED UP THE PRICE ALMOST\nHALFWAY THERE FROM THE PEAK TO THE BOTTOM SO THE OPENING BELL\nIS JUST AHEAD AND IT IS COOL &amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU ARE WATCHING THE CHINA\nSHOW COUNTING DOWN TO THE OPENING OF MARKETS. REALLY THE NEWS FROM TRUMP LOOKS LIKE MORE HAWKISH SIGNALS\nON CHINA AND GERMAN ELECTIONS. DAVID: FUTURES PUSHING HIGHER,\nON THE U.S. SIDE THE TARIFF CONVERSATION --\nTHE MORE CREDIBLE THE THREAT BECOMES. HAS IT BEEN ENOUGH TO OFFSET\nCONCERNS? SOME OF THE DEFENSE STRATEGIES\nAND DEFENSE HEAVY FUNDS ARE SOMETHING NEW GIVEN THE\nGYRATIONS IN POLITICS, WEAKNESS ACROSS THE BOARD. WE WILL TALK MORE IN A MOMENT,\nGOOD WEEK FOR CG B&amp;#39;S. CHANGED THE PAGE PLEASE. SLIGHTLY BETTER, WE ARE PUSHING\nLOWER ON MOST OF THE BENCHMARKS. WE ARE NEARING\nMILESTONES, 23,000, THAT IS THE PEAK IN OCTOBER, MSCI CHINA\nIS 76 AND CHANGE BUT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE WE WILL GET THERE\nTODAY. ENCOURAGING NEWS ON NEW DRUG\nAPPLICATIONS. WE ARE UP ON HONG KONG AND I\nWILL TELL YOU WHY. ONLINE GAMING STOCKS EASED AND\nYOU DO THE MATH, 113. LET&amp;#39;S GET MORE CONTEXT. REBECCA:\nWE WILL DIG IN WITH OUR SENIOR EQUITIES REPORTER FROM\nSINGAPORE. ALSO STEVEN CHU, LET&amp;#39;S START\nWITH YOU. WHAT IS DRIVING THE SELLOFF? STEPHEN: PBOC HAS BEEN KEEPING THE POLICY RATE AT 1.5% SO FROM A\nLEVERAGE PERSPECTIVE THAT IS FORCING HOLDERS TO SELL AND THE\nMARKET HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTED AND WE KNOW DEEPSEEK, THE RISE\nOF EQUITY MARKETS EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT EQUITIES SO CHINA&amp;#39;S ECONOMY HELPS YIELDS TO\nRISE, WE HAVE THE MARCH SESSION IN CHINA WILL ANNOUNCE THE NEW\nSUPPLY OF BONDS, MARKET IS EXPECTING A RECORD YEAR. DAVID:\nEVERYTHING IS PUSHING HIGHER, CAN IT CONTINUE? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE TALK ABOUT RECORD LOW 10\nYEAR YIELDS EVERY SESSION AND NOW THEY HAVE REBOUNDED. I THINK YIELDS MIGHT BE TOO LOW\nAND AT LEAST SPACE GOING TO BE CLOSER TO DAVID: 2%.\nOUR -- ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS HAVE A PIECE OUT, GIVE\nUS SOME CONTEXT AND WHAT CHINA MEANS FOR EMERGING MARKETS? A BHISHEK: CHINA HAS OUTPERFORMED , EMS\nARE LOOKING TO DO A CATCH UP. LOOKING AT EMERGING MARKETS\nEXCLUDING CHINA, DOLLAR WEAKNESS AND MOVING SLOWER ON TARIFFS THERE IS UNDERTONE OF\nUNCERTAINTY BUT EMERGING MARKETS PLAYED CATCH UP TO\nCHINA, BUT NOT AS BIG AS WHAT CHINA HAS DONE, BUT THIS IS A TRADING SECTOR, LIKE WHAT WE\nHAVE SEEN IN CHINA. THE MARCH SESSION, WHAT MARKETS\nMAKE OF IT AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP DOES WHEN\nTHE TRADE REPORTS COME IN. THAT IS THE PRIORITY. THAT IS WHERE THE THESIS WILL\nDILUTE. REBECCA: I WANT TO ASK ABOUT TRUMP NEWS,\nCOMMENTARY THAT IS MORE WIDE-RANGING AND THE 10%\nNUMBER, TO WHAT EXTENT ARE WE SEEING MARKETS REACT? DOES IT FEEL LIKE THE RALLY HAS\nLEGS? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SECOND PART HAS LEGS, IT\nHAS LEGS. AND THE FIRST PART, VIEWS ARE\nMIXED. UBS WERE NOT OPTIMISTIC BUT I\nWAS TALKING TO A STRATEGIST AND THAT GUY WAS SAYING IT IS PRICED IN AND ADDS A DAWN OF\nNEGATIVITY IN TERMS OF AT WAXMAN&amp;#39;S -- ADVANCEMENTS. LOOKING TO SPEND MORE YOU NOW\nIN THE MARKET, THOSE THINGS POINT OUT CHINA WOULD HAVE LEGS.\nDEFINITELY A BREATHER, IT&amp;#39;S A MARATHON BUT IT -- IT -- IT\nWON&amp;#39;T CHANGE PERSPECTIVE ON CHINESE STOCKS. DAVID:\nLET&amp;#39;S HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT. IT&amp;#39;S THANK YOU, OUR SENIOR\nEQUITIES REPORTER IN SINGAPORE. AND STEVEN CHU, FX AND RATE\nSTRATEGIST AT BLOOMBERG&amp;#39;S INTELLIGENCE. NEW EARNINGS NUMBER UP TO 875\nMILLION DOLLARS FOR LOSSES, PATRICK WONG IS HERE SO WE NOW HAVE A RANGE FOR EUROPE, ARE\nTHEY IN A WORSE PLACE? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY HAVE PROBLEM AND BASICALLY THEY APOLOGIZED, IT IS GETTING CHALLENGED AND\nOFFICE PRICES DEFINITELY IS FALLING DOWN IN HONG KONG SO BASICALLY THE CHALLENGE IS FURTHER INCREASE, BASICALLY WE\nWILL GET MORE DETAILS. REBECCA:\nTHERE HAS BEEN OPTIMISM FROM BONDS AND A REFINANCING PLAN\nWITH COLLATERAL. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CONCERN IS ON ASSETS\nWHICH POTENTIALLY COULD BE BUYING TIME POTENTIALLY LATER,\nHONG KONG AND CHINA WE WILL SEE HOW IT GOES, ONE OR TWO YEARS\nAND THEN THEY HAVE TO BE OK FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SO THE\nCHALLENGE IS THE LEVERAGE. LOTS OF CONCERN FOR INVESTORS\nBUT WE WILL SEE IF WE BOUNCE. DAVID: EQUITY IS EASY BUT THIS IS A\nCREDIT STORY, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE RISK OF THE CREDIT, WE\nARE CLOSER TO A NAME LIKE V ANKA.\nTHEY WOULD NOT PUT THEMSELVES IN THAT BASKET AND SHARES ARE\nUP, 5% OR JUST UNDER THAT FROM FRIDAY I THINK THE QUESTION,\nCAN NEW WORLD LOOK TO DEVELOPMENTS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL\n-- ON THE FUNDAMENTAL BUSINESS? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I THINK DEFINITELY. HAPPENING WE SEE STATE OWNED\nDEVELOPERS BUYING LAND IN THE MARKET TO PAY SOME EXTRA\nPREMIUM. ALSO TAKE SOME TIME TO SEE HOW IT GOES AND NEW WORLDS IS\nHAVING ADEQUATE MOMENTUM IN SALES. DAVID: THE -- THE STORY THAT\nDEVELOPERS ARE BUYING LAND, HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SOME OF THEM CAN REALLY SELL SOME OF THE PROJECTS AND\nSUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS IMPORTANT. IT IS A GOOD SIGNAL. REBECCA: ONE POSITIVE SIGNAL WE ARE\nSEEING IN CHINESE PROPERTY. PATRICK WONG JOINING US AND\nZELENSKYY SAYS HE IS WILLING TO TRADE HIS PRESIDENCY FOR PEACE\nAND NATO MEMBERSHIP. DAVID: A LOOK INTO DRONE PRODUCTION AT\nTHE FOREFRONT OF THE BATTLEFIELDS OF THE WORLD.\nSPECIAL REPORT JUST AHEAD. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. REBECCA: ZELINKSI\nWILL STEP DOWN IF PEACE IS POSSIBLE. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I AM READY TO TRADE FOR NATO\nMEMBERSHIP TODAY. I&amp;#39;M NOT GOING TO BE IN POWER\nFOR DECADES. REBECCA: LET&amp;#39;S BRING IN DEREK WALLBANK.\nWHY IS THIS SUCH A HOT BUTTON TOPIC? DEREK: ZELENSKYY STATUS IS A TALKING\nPOINT, TRUMP AND ZELENSKYY HAVE HAD A FALLING OUT IN ONE KEY\nTHING IS ELECTIONS IN UKRAINE, SOMETHING RUSSIA HAS BEEN\nPUSHING FOR. ZELENSKYY HAS LOW POLL NUMBERS\nEVEN THOUGH THEY ARE HIGHER THAN TRUMP HAS SAID.\nTHEY ARE LOWER THAN WHEN THE INVASION IN STARTED, THERE IS\nNOT A PROSPECT FOR NATO MEMBERSHIP SO IT&amp;#39;S NOT REALLY ON THE TABLE BUT HE IS WILLING\nTO TALK ABOUT A UKRAINE THAT HE IS NOT THE HEAD OF. ZELENSKYY IS TRYING TO SET UP\nEXPLICIT U.S. SECURITY GUARANTEES, NOT\nECONOMIC BUT MILITARY. AS THE U.S. IN UKRAINE TRY TO COME TO TERMS, GUARANTEEING SECURITY AND THERE WILL BE CONVERSATIONS\nBETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA ON THE CONTOURS OF A\nPEACE DEAL AND LAND WILL BE IMPORTANT, TOP OF MIND IS HOW WE MAKE SURE THERE IS A PAUSE BETWEEN\nINVASIONS. DAVID: DEREK IN SINGAPORE. SPEAKING OF THE BATTLEFIELD WE\nWILL HAVE SPECIAL COVERAGE INTO THE ARMS RACE FOR DRONES\nINVOLVING THE U.S. AND CHINA. IN A CULTURAL -- ANNABELLE\nDROULERS EXPLAINS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; NO QUESTION THAT DRONES HAVE\nALTERED THE MILITARY. THEY&amp;#39;VE BEEN IN USE FOR DECADES.\nON TODAY&amp;#39;S BATTLEFIELDS IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THE SHEER\nVOLUME IN THE SKIES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE WAR IN UKRAINE IS A\nDRONE WAR. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED, A\nSIGNAL OF WHAT IS AHEAD WITH THE U.S.\nSPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; A MAJOR WAR WILL VERY MUCH\nBE A DRONE WAR. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; TECHNOLOGY MOVES FAST. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\nAIR SUPERIORITY IS NOT JUST ABOUT FIGHTER JETS, IT IS ABOUT AI POWERED SYSTEMS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\nMILITARIES NEED LESS ADVANCED DRONES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY HAVE BEEN INVESTING\n, IT IS THE LOWER END STUFF THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO BUILD\nUP. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; CHINA SUPPLIES 80% OF THE\nGLOBAL MARKET. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; CHEAP DRONES CAN BE ADAPTED\nFOR THE MILITARY. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; CHINA IS PUTTING INTENSE\nCAPITAL , IT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN VICTORY AND DEFEAT. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; RIVALS ARE RACING TO CATCH\nUP. REBECCA: ANNABELLE JOINS US FROM HONG\nKONG. CHINA ARE DOMINATING SALES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; YEAH, JUST GOING BACK TO THE\nSUPPLY CHAIN, IT IS WELL AND TRULY CHINA.\nHOW IT CAN BE WEAPONIZED IS THE CHALLENGE.\nTHEY NEED NO COMPONENTS MADE IN CHINA. THIS IS A TYPE OF DRONE USED IN\nUKRAINE THAT PUTS THE -- THE -- THE PILOT IN THE COCKPIT\nTHROUGH A VIDEO FEED. TODAY THE MAIN PRODUCER IS\nCHINA, FOR ALL DRONE COMPONENTS. EXTRICATING AWAY FROM THE\nSUPPLY CHAIN IS CHALLENGING AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING. IN TAIWAN THEY ARE TALKING TO\nGOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO UNDERSTAND THE PUSH TAIWAN IS\nMAKING. AND DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS\nWITH THE U.S. AND ALLIES, GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT AGREEMENTS IN\nRUSSIA, IT IN UKRAINE. QUITE THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR\nTAIWAN. DAVID: WE WILL STAY TUNED. LATER ON WE WILL DISCUSS\nCHINA&amp;#39;S DEFENSE STRATEGY FOR THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.\nSPEAKING TO A SENIOR FELLOW FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND\nSTRATEGY. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. DAVID:\nWELCOME BACK TO THE CHINA SHOW. LAST FEW MINUTES, ALIBABA\nREPORTEDLY INVESTING 380 BILLION INTO AI, YOU SIMPLY DO THE MATH, ALIBABA SITTING ON\nCASH, THEY WILL TAP IT AS WELL BUT THE MARKET IS LISTENING. ALIBABA AND THE BENCHMARK IT\nOPENED LOWER, PLENTY MORE AHEAD, COMING OFF A SIX WEEK\nRUN THIS MONDAY MORNING. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WELCOME BACK, JUST ENTERING\nWHAT? THE SECOND HOUR OF THE CHINA\nSHOW. WE STARTED OFF FAIRLY...\nQUIET, THEN THE LATEST ON THE TRUMP STORY, SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT OUT OF ALIBABA. REBECCA: SPENDING ON AI, WE TALKED ABOUT\nAI OFFSETTING TARIFF RISKS AROUND THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY\nFUNNELED OFF THE BACK OF THIS. DAVID:\nTHE REPORT IS ONLY 2.5 WHYS SO WE DON&amp;#39;T HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS\nBUT MARKETS LISTENED. COMING OFF HIGHS AND OTHER\nSTORIES, WE HAD INDEX REVIEW ON FRIDAY AND I DON&amp;#39;T NEED TO TELL\nYOU WHICH STOCKS WERE ADDED BUT THERE WERE SOME CHANGES,\nHORIZON ROBOTICS AND TENCENT MUSIC. BACK TO THE GEOPOLITICAL STORY, SHIPPING STOCKS ARE DOWN\nON THE PROPOSAL OF SHIPPING FEES FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. NOT A LOT AS FAR AS OTHER NAMES BUT THE OTHER STORY CATCHING\nATTENTION IS VACCINE AND TEST KIT MAKER STOCKS, JAPAN IS\nCLOSED. RESEARCHERS AT THE WUHAN INSTITUTE, THE -- THE -- THE\nDISCOVERY OF A COVID LIKE VIRUS, IT&amp;#39;S -- IT&amp;#39;S -- IT&amp;#39;S\nWORTH NOTING THAT THE VIRUS HAS YET TO BE SEEN IN HUMANS TO\nDOWNPLAY THAT -- THAT BIT, BUT MARKETS ARE REACTING. REBECCA:\nTHE STORY NO ONE WANTS TO READ. THE OTHER THING WE ARE WATCHING\nFOR HIS ASIAN CENTRAL BANKS, DECISIONS FROM BANK OF KOREA,\nBANK OF THAILAND BUT THE FOCUS WILL BE U.S.\nGDP AND PCE DATER, THE PREFERRED GAUGE. DAVID: ABSOLUTELY, IS THIS -- CAN WE\nTRUST THE PRICING AROUND THE FED CUTS NOW? CUTS CHRIST? AND THE NVIDIA RESULTS MIDWEEK\nAS WELL ON THE AI STORY AND U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM. MARK CRANFIELD JOINS US NOW AS\nWE GET UNDERWAY. MARK:\nALIBABA HEADLINE IS IMPRESSIVE. MARKETS WILL LIKE THAT AND THE\nAI NARRATIVE IS BUILDING UP, SO THROW MORE ONTO THE FIRE. INTERESTING SITUATION, WE&amp;#39;VE\nSPOKEN ABOUT DECOUPLING VARIOUS TIMES WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT CHINA\nCOULD DECOUPLE FROM THE U.S. AND IT NEVER HAPPENED, THE\nWORLD FOLLOWS U.S. MARKETS AND WE COULD GET\nSOMETHING MORE SERIOUS BECAUSE CHINA HAS ITS OWN STORY WITH AI AND SOME GOVERNMENT COMPANIES ADOPTED DEEPSEEK PRODUCTS AND\nTHERE IS POTENTIAL THAT FINALLY CHINESE TECH STOCKS MIGHT BE\nBETTER THAN U.S. PEERS. THE STORY IS TIRED. MAYBE CHINA CAN PICK UP THE\nTHEME REGARDLESS OF THE U.S. AND REST OF THE WORLD. A COMPANY LIKE ALIBABA MAY BE\nTHE DECOUPLING WILL HAPPEN WITH THE BIG OUTPERFORMANCE. REBECCA:\nI WANT TO ASK ABOUT GERMANY AND THE READ THROUGH&amp;#39;S AND I\nSUPPOSE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HOW QUICKLY THIS COMES TOGETHER. MARK:\nTHAT&amp;#39;S WHAT YOU&amp;#39;RE SEEING WITH THE EURO EXCHANGE RATES, THAT\nIS RELIEF. TRADERS ARE HAPPY TO SEE A GOOD\nCHANCE -- THERE WAS FEAR THAT THE RESULT WOULD BE SUCH A\nMESS, WE MIGHT GET NOTHING HAPPENING IN THE BIG POLICY\nDRIFT WITH NO LEADERSHIP BUT THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE\nCASE. THAT&amp;#39;S WHAT MARKETS LIKE, NO\nCONCERN OVER WHO WINS, THEY JUST WANT A MANDATE THAT LOOKS\nAS THOUGH IT HAS POTENTIAL. DAVID:\nOTHER ITEMS ON THE AGENDA IS NVIDIA EARNINGS. WHAT WILL BE MORE CONSEQUENTIAL?\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NVIDIA YEAR -- NVIDIA IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE\nOUTLOOK, WHETHER THEY WILL PRODUCE THE RESULTS THEY HAVE\nBEEN AND THE FED SITUATION WITH INFLATION EXPRESSING CONCERN\nOVER THE CHANGE OF ADMINISTRATION IN THE U.S.\nAND POLICIES COULD BE INFLATIONARY. BLOOMBERG THINKS IT WILL BE A\nSOFT NUMBER, IT COULD BE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE\nPOLICIES BUT BOTH EVENTS CAN CAUSE VOLATILITY SO EXCITING\nWEEK WHICHEVER WAY IT PLAYS. REBECCA:\nMARK CRANFIELD, I&amp;#39;M SURE WE WILL TALK TO YOU.\nWE HAVE THE GERMAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN CHINA JOINING US.\nTHAT IS NEXT SO STAY WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE&amp;#39;VE MADE A TOUGH CAMPAIGN THAT WAS NECESSARY AND A DEBATE\nABOUT POLICY, MIGRATION, INTERNAL SECURITY, BUT NOW WE\nWILL TALK TO EACH OTHER AND ESTABLISH A VIABLE GOVERNMENT\nAS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. REBECCA: JIM CONSERVATIVE LEADER\nFREDERICK MAERSK AFTER HIS BLOCK WAS PROJECTED TO WIN THE\nELECTION AND JUST SEEING REACTIONS IN CHINA, BEIJING IS\nPROMOTING HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE AND GERMANIC TIES. THE RELATIONSHIP IS OF\nSIGNIFICANCE AND CHINA&amp;#39;S GERMANY POLICY WILL REMAIN\nUNCHANGED. DAVID: CHINA APPRECIATES GERMANY&amp;#39;S\nRATIONALE ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES. EXPRESSING HOPE THAT THEY WILL\nLOVE SOLVE TENSIONS AFFECTING TRADE TIES ACROSS INDUSTRIES. LET&amp;#39;S TALK MORE ABOUT\nIMPLICATIONS AND GERMAN COMPANIES IN CHINA.\nJOINING US IS MAXIMILIAN FROM THE GERMAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\nIN EAST CHINA OUT OF SHANGHAI. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME\nTO SPEAK WITH US. HOW DO THESE EVENTS AFFECT\nCOMPANIES UNDER YOUR WATCH ACROSS THE WORLD? MAXIMILIAN:\nTHANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. IT&amp;#39;S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE\nGOVERNMENT RETHINKS CHALLENGES AND TRANSATLANTIC\nRELATIONS WHICH ARE NOT AS THEY WERE BEFORE SO WE WILL REENGAGE\nWITH CHINA. REBECCA: WE HAVE HAD COMMENTARY ABOUT\nCHINA, HOW ARE THE INVESTORS THINKING IN RESPONDING TO THE\nTHINGS THAT ARE PROJECTED TO COME THROUGH? MAXIMILIAN:\nCOMPANIES HAVE CHALLENGES IN CHINA. THE INVESTMENT CONFIDENCE IS\nNOT DOING WELL IN CHINA, BUT IMPORTS FROM GERMANY ARE LESS\nCOMPETITIVE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH ENERGY PRICES AND COSTS OF\nOPERATIONS. THE NEW GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO FOCUS ON COMPETITIVENESS AND\nALSO GET INTO A BETTER DISCUSSION WITH CHINA.\nYOU MENTIONED WE HAVE TARIFFS ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHICH\nCAUSE TENSIONS SO WE HOPE THEY CAN BE TRANSFERRED INTO OPEN\nDIALOGUE TO TACKLE CHALLENGES AND ENABLE OPPORTUNITIES. GERMANY CANNOT BE COMPETITIVE\nIF THEY ARE NOT INVESTED IN CHINA. DAVID: MAYBE JUST TO TIE WHAT IS GOING ON AS GEOPOLITICS TO THE\nREPORT, GERMAN COMPANIES CAN ONLY BE COMPETITIVE IF THEY\nBRING RHD INTO CHINA, TIE THOSE TWO THINGS FOR US. MAXIMILIAN: FIRST OF ALL IT IS REMARKABLE\nTHAT GERMAN COMPANIES IN CHINA GET TO FEEL GEOPOLITICAL\nTENSIONS BECAUSE IN THE PAST THEY DID NOT FOCUS ON TENSIONS\nBUT WITH TENSIONS NOT ONLY FROM WASHINGTON BUT BRUSSELS IT\nFORCE THEM TO RETHINK ENGAGEMENT SO WHILE THEY ARE\nDIVERSIFYING OUTSIDE OF CHINA TO SERVE THE U.S.\nAND EUROPEAN MARKET THEY UNDERSTOOD HOW IMPORTANT IT IS\nTO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND BUILD SUPPLY CHAINS HERE, THAT&amp;#39;S WHY\nWE CALLED IT LOCALIZATION 3.0, BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONLY\nPRODUCTION IN CHINA, IT IS INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND\nDEVELOPMENT TO SERVE THE LOCAL MARKET AND NOT MISS OUT ON THE\nECOSYSTEM IN CHINA. WHAT HAPPENED WITH DEEPSEEK\nSHOWED CHINA IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE HIGH-TECH\nSECTOR AND GERMAN COMPANIES HAVE TO INVEST. REBECCA:\nUH, WE&amp;#39;VE SEEN THE EXODUS OF FOREIGN FIRMS BOTTOMING OUT EVEN IF INVESTMENT IS REALLY\nPLUNGING. GERMAN FUNDS AND INVESTMENT\nMIGHT BE THE EXCEPTION OF LAST YEAR BUT GERMAN FIRMS THAT ARE\nSTAYING, HOW ARE THEY THINKING ABOUT THE RISK OF THE CROSS\nHAIRS OF U.S. AND CHINA RELATIONS?\nNOT JUST FOR EXAMPLE ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND TRADE TENSIONS?\nMAXIMILIAN: NO, YOU ARE RIGHT AND THE\nQUESTIONS IS WILL SOFTWARE DEVELOPED IN CHINA BE\nIMPLEMENTED IN THE U.S. AND 10 U.S.\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN THE U.S. CONTINUE TO IMPORT TO CHINA AND\nBE USED HERE AT THE MOMENT? IT MIGHT BE CHALLENGING AND WE\nDON&amp;#39;T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT DECOUPLING BUT THIS IS A\nSCENARIO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT, GERMAN COMPANIES TRYING TO\nMITIGATE THE RISK HAS PROVEN THEY INVEST BECAUSE THEY SEE\nTHE MARKET IS RELEVANT AND THEY SEE THEIR OWN COMPETITIVENESS\nWHILE COMPANIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES MIGHT NOT SEE A\nFUTURE. DAVID: UH, CAN I ASK YOU SINCE THE\nPRESENCE IS STILL, YOU KNOW, INCREASING IF -- IF NOT\nREMAINING THE SAME, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING AS FAR AS DEMAND FOR\nFINAL GOODS AND MAINLAND CHINA BECAUSE WE HEAR COMPANIES TALK\nABOUT PRICE PRESSURES ACROSS SECTORS, WHAT ARE YOUR MEMBERS\nTELLING YOU? MAXIMILIAN: THE SENTIMENT SHORT-TERM IS\nNEGATIVE BECAUSE THE LACK OF DEMAND LED TO FIERCE PRICE WARS\nWHERE IS HARD TO MAKE PROFITS WITH COMPANIES UP ALSO SEEING\nTHIS AS A CHANCE AND THEY ARE QUITE SURE THEY CAN SURVIVE AND\nCOME OUT STRONGER BY BEING FORCED TO BECOME EFFICIENT,\nINCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND LOWER COSTS, GERMAN COMPANIES WILL BE\nMORE COMPETITIVE SO THE SENTIMENT SHORT-TERM IS\nNEGATIVE BUT MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM IT IS NOT. REBECCA: WHAT MESSAGE ARE YOU TAKING TO\nCHINESE OFFICIALS AND POLICYMAKERS AND HOW RECEPTIVE\nARE THEY? MAXIMILIAN: YEAH, YOU KNOW, FOR US, IT IS\nUNDERSTANDABLE THAT THE CHINESE MARKET PROTECTED THE MARKET BUT\nCHINESE COMPANIES BECAME SO STRONG, THERE IS NO NEED TO\nPROTECT LOCAL COMPANIES SO A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WILL BE\nCRUCIAL TO INVEST FURTHER AND THE CHINESE TRANSITION TO HIGH\nTECH, THEY NEED GERMAN COMPANIES AND THE CHINESE\nGOVERNMENT IS ASKING WHAT THEY CAN DO. WE EXPECT ACTIONS IN POLICY ETC.\n, SO GERMAN COMPANIES CAN GROW. DAVID: RIGHT -- RIGHT -- RIGHT.\nTHEY ARE ASKING WHAT THEY CAN DO TO MAKE LIFE BETTER SO WHAT\nIS THE ANSWER? MAXIMILIAN: THE QUESTION IS HOW TO INCLUDE\nUS BETTER, THEY NEED TO INVOLVE US AND WE NEED THE SAME\nSUBSIDIES AND ACCESS TO CREDIT AND UNIVERSITIES. REBECCA:\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE INSIGHTS.\nGERMAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN EAST CHINA.\nWE WILL HAVE MORE ANALYSIS OF GERMAN ELECTIONS, WHAT IT MEANS\nFOR CHINA AHEAD. WE WILL HEAR FROM PETERSON\nINSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS, WHY CONSERVATIVE OPPOSITION LEADER\nDID NOT QUIT THE ELECTION IN THE WAY HE WOULD HAVE WANTED. REBECCA:\nGOOD MORNING, HERE ARE SOME OF THE TOP STORIES TODAY. THREE OF BYTEDANCE&amp;#39;S MAJOR\nINVESTORS HAVE MARKED OFF TIKTOK VALUATIONS.\nSOFTBANK REEVALUATED THE FIRM FACTORING IN POTENTIAL FOR AI\nBUSINESS. FIDELITY INVESTMENTS ALSO\nMARKED UP BYTEDANCE, A SHARP REBOUND. SHEIN&amp;#39;S PROFITS SLUMPED BY 40%\nLAST YEAR, NET INCOME SLIPPED TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS AS SALES\nJUMPED 19%. INTERNAL PROJECTIONS WERE TO BE\nMADE BEFORE ACCOUNTS WERE FINALIZED.\nTHEY FILED FOR A LONDON IPO AND ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO CUT THEIR\nVALUATION TO 13 BILLION. BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY CUT THEIR\nEARNINGS DRIVEN BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND RECOVERY IN\nINSURANCE UNDERWRITING. THEY ARE AT A RECORD $334\nBILLION AT THE END OF 2024. WARREN BUFFETT EXPECTS PRETAX\nLOSSES OF 1.3 BILLION FROM THE L.A. WILDFIRES. DAVID: THE ANNUAL LETTER IS WHAT THEY\nSAY ABOUT WHERE THE COMPANY IS LOOKING TO INCREASE EXPOSURE SO\nWHAT THE ORACLE OF OMAHA BUYS IS A GOOD INDICATOR, IT HAS\nHAPPENED IN JAPAN. REBECCA: THE COMPANY WILL INCREASE\nOWNERSHIP OF JAPAN&amp;#39;S LARGEST FIVE TRADING HOUSES OVER TIME.\nDAVID: AND I THINK THE FIRST TIME THE\nCHART SHOWS YOU BACK IN AUGUST OF 2020 THAT THEY WERE LOOKING TO DO THIS, SINCE THEN NAMES\nLIKE MITSUBISHI WHICH BY THE WAY HAVE TAKEN A BACKSEAT AS\nFAR AS THE GLOBAL FOOTPRINT OF INVESTORS IN JAPAN ARE BACK IN\nTHE SPOTLIGHT. REBECCA: THEY INTENDED TO KEEP THEIR\nSTAKE BELOW 10% BUT THE FIVE COMPANIES AGREED TO MODERATE\nREAD -- RELAX THE CEILING. DAVID: A BAD MASSAGE.\nYOU NEED TO RELAX AFTER THAT SESSION.\nJAPAN IS SHUT FOR THE EMPEROR&amp;#39;S BIRTHDAY.\nIT&amp;#39;S OTHER STORIES, LET&amp;#39;S START WITH A PIPIT TO SINGAPORE AND\nHONG KONG, LISTED SHARES ON YOUR SCREEN.\nS GX REPORTS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OUT OF SINGAPORE THAT THEY WILL\nINVEST 5 BILLION IN FUND MANAGERS TO LIFT THE STOCK.\nHKS IS DOWN. MORGAN STANLEY IS AT FOUR 50.\nMORGAN STANLEY RAISING ALIBABA ADRS TO OVERWEIGHT. REPORTING MAY BE MORE POLICY\nSUPPORT AS IT PERTAINS TO RECYCLING AND REUSE AS FAR AS\nELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES. CATL IS GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY. REBECCA:\nCLOSELY WATCHED FOR THE LEVEL OF STATE SUPPORT, BUT IT LOOKS\nLIKE AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE WHEN IT COMES TO BEIJING AND\nTHE STATE OFFERING TO STEP IN TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPER. DAVID:\nWE WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO CHINESE DEVELOPERS BUYING\nLAND AT A PREMIUM, MORE OF THEM ARE DOING THAT WHICH IS\nINDICATIVE OF GREEN SHOOTS IN THE HOUSING MARKET ON THE\nMAINLAND. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE BEEN MOSTLY POSITIVE\nOVER THE LAST 30 MINUTES. THE JURY IS OUT. INVESTING INTO AI, THE FIGURE\nIS 53 BILLION U.S. OFF TO A DECENT START AGAINST\nTHE BACKDROP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. JAPAN IS CLOSED TODAY, SO WE\nARE DOWN 51%. WE ARE COMING OFF A BIG DROP ON\nFRIDAY. IT IS PERHAPS INDICATIVE OF\nWHAT THE SESSION MIGHT LOOK LIKE GOING INTO LATER ON MONDAY.\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt; BACK TO ONE OF OUR TOP STORIES AND LINKED TO THIS\nTHEME OF HOW MARKETS ARE REACTING TO THE TRADE NEWS, IT\nSEEMS CHINA VERY MUCH OVERTAKEN BY THE ALIBABA NEWS.\nWE DID HAVE U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT\nBESSENT AND THE CHINESE VICE PREMIER EXCHANGING COMPLAINTS\nOVER TARIFFS AND BEIJING&amp;#39;S ECONOMIC MODEL IN THEIR FIRST\nDISCUSSIONS AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE.\nWE LEARNED WASHINGTON IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON MEXICO TO\nSTOP TARIFFS ON CHINESE IMPORTS. DAVID:\nAMERICA&amp;#39;S FIRST INVESTMENT POLICY THAT LABELED CHINA AN\nADVERSARY. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANOTHER POTENTIAL FLASHPOINT\nBETWEEN BEIJING AND WASHINGTON IS EUROPE AND THE ROLE CHINA\nCOULD PLAY IN THE POSSIBLE CEASE-FIRE IN UKRAINE.\nJOINING US IS RETIRED SENIOR COLONEL OF CHINA&amp;#39;S PEOPLE&amp;#39;S\nLIBERATION ARMY ZHOU BO AND CURRENTLY A SENIOR FELLOW FOR INTERNATIONAL\nSECURITY AND STRATEGY. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT SOME OF THE\nSPECIFICS OF THE ROLE THAT CHINA CAN PLAY AS A POTENTIAL\nPEACEMAKER WHEN IT COMES TO MOSCOW&amp;#39;S RULE WITH UKRAINE.\nDO YOU THINK BEIJING SEES ITSELF AS A POSSIBLE GUARANTOR\nFOR EUROPEAN SECURITY? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ACTUALLY I BELIEVE CHINA CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THIS WAR, IF A\nCEASE-FIRE IS IN PLACE. WHY IS THAT? UKRAINIANS DEEPLY REMEMBER THE\nPLEDGES OF THE FIVE NUCLEAR POWERS WHEN THEY DECIDED TO\nRELINQUISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THAT GUARANTEE WAS NOT VERY\nMUCH SUBSTANTIVE AND THE FIVE POWERS COULD NOT PROVIDE A\nSO-CALLED POSITIVE GUARANTEE. GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF THE\nSITUATION, I BELIEVE UKRAINE WILL BE AFRAID IF THERE IS NO\nGUARANTEE. RUSSIA ALSO NEEDS THE KIND OF\nSECURITY GUARANTEE BECAUSE RUSSIA DOESN&amp;#39;T WANT TO STAND\nLOOKING ISOLATED. THE WHOLE WEST IS BEHIND\nUKRAINE. PRESIDENT PUTIN TALKED ABOUT\nHOW CHINA, INDIA, AND BRAZIL CAN BE BROKERS.\nTHAT&amp;#39;S THE FIRST THING. THE SECOND IS A BIG IF.\nIF PEACEKEEPING IS NEEDED, THEN OF COURSE CHINA AND OTHER\nCOUNTRIES FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO\nPLAY THIS ROLE. RUSSIA WILL SIMPLY TAKE THESE\nCOUNTRIES AS A WOLF IN SHEEP&amp;#39;S CLOTHING.\nOTHERWISE, WHY WOULD RUSSIA HAVE THIS WAR AFTER ALL?\nIT IS BECAUSE OF NATO. WITH EVERYTHING IS MOST OBVIOUS\nGIVEN -- CHINA DEFINITELY CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE\nIN TERMS OF THE WORLD WITH UKRAINE BECAUSE CHINA CAN DO\nTHINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY AT LOWER COST. REBECCA:\nIT&amp;#39;S INTERESTING YOU TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR CHINA TO\nCOOPERATE WITH COUNTRIES FROM THE GLOBAL SOUTH AND SO ON IN\nTERMS OF THE POTENTIAL FOR PEACEKEEPING.\nTHE OTHER POINT THAT IS IMPORTANT IS CHINA HAS THE\nLARGEST BASE OF PEACEKEEPING FORCES WITHIN THE U.N.\nAND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE YOU AND SECURITY COMMISSIONER. BUT TYPICALLY CHINA DOES NOT\nSEND TROOPS IN ANYWHERE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION AND TYPICALLY HAS\nNOT PLAYED THE ROLE OF THIS SECURITY GUARANTOR SO I WONDER\nHOW YOU ASSESS CHINA&amp;#39;S WILLINGNESS TO SEND\nPEACEKEEPING FORCES INTO UKRAINE. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; FOR PEACEKEEPING TO\nHAPPEN, THE WARRING PARTIES HAVE TO HAVE CONSENT OF THE\nPERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE UNC COUNCIL. ONE OF THE WARRING PARTIES IS A\nPERMANENT MEMBER. IF PEACEKEEPING IS NEEDED AND\nHAS TO BE AUTHORIZED BY THE U.N., THIS HAS TO BE A SPECIAL\nARRANGEMENT. BECAUSE OF CHINA&amp;#39;S CONTRIBUTION\nTO PEACEKEEPING THAT CAN BE SEEN BY EVERYBODY, I THINK\nCHINA IS BETTER POSITIONED TO PLAY THIS ROLE. AND BECAUSE HE CAN BE TRUSTED,\nTHE IMPARTIALITY IS ONE OF THE PRECONDITIONS FOR PEAK --\nPEACEKEEPING. FOR THE FIRST TIME CHINA WILL\nBE HAVING A ROLE IN THE SECURITY OF FOR EUROPE, THAT IS\nSOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED. DAVID:\nMY QUESTION TAKES A STATE -- STEP BACK. DAVID HERE.\nYOU HAVE BEEN QUICK TO EMPHASIZE THE ROLE CHINA PLAYS\nIS POST ANY CEASE-FIRE. IS THERE ANY ROLE YOU THINK\nCHINA CAN PLAY THAT BRINGS US CLOSER TO A CEASE-FIRE? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I HAVE SOME DOUBTS ABOUT\nTHIS. THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION\nBECAUSE RIGHT NOW RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE HAVING\nDIRECT TALKS. I BELIEVE UKRAINE SHOULD HAVE\nBEEN INVITED. OTHERWISE IT LOOKS A BIT LIKE WHAT THE SOVIETS IN GERMANY DID\nTO HAVE SPHERES OF INFLUENCE. UKRAINE IS THE COUNTRY BEING\nINVADED. THIS IS NOT ALSO FAIR FOR\nUKRAINE I WOULD SAY. AT THIS STAGE I DON&amp;#39;T BELIEVE\nCHINA CAN PLAY A VERY BIG ROLE. I BELIEVE CHINA&amp;#39;S ROLE WILL COME WHEN THEY HAVE\nNEGOTIATIONS WITH SHORT-TERM GUARANTEE AND THEN CHINA CAN\nJOIN OTHER POWERS IN PROVIDING THIS GUARANTY, AND THEN CHINA\nCAN DO PEACEKEEPING AND POSTWAR RECONSTRUCTION.\nSO CHINA&amp;#39;S ROLE CAN COME A LITTLE BIT LATER. REBECCA:\nTHERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SO-CALLED REVERSE\nNIXON POSSIBILITY HERE, THE IDEA THAT THE U.S.\nWILL MOVE TO SPLIT OR CREATE MORE DISTANCE BETWEEN PRESIDENT\nXI JINPING AND PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN.\nHOW CONCERNED DO YOU THINK BEIJING IS ABOUT THAT POSSIBLE\nSCENARIO? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THAT IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE.\nJUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT, AND THE POST-PUTIN AREA, WE DON&amp;#39;T\nKNOW WHEN THAT WILL BE. GIVEN THAT CHINA AND RUSSIA ARE\nNEIGHBORS TO EACH OTHER, WHOEVER COMES INTO THE KREMLIN\nWOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER THIS FACT THAT WE ARE THE LARGEST\nNEIGHBORS TOWARD EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE MUST HAVE AN\nAMICABLE RELATIONSHIP. I BELIEVE RUSSIA&amp;#39;S BEST CHANCE\nOF TILTING TOWARD THE ROAD -- THE WEST, EVEN PUTIN WOULD WANT\nTO JOIN NATO. BUT EVEN THAT TIME THAT KIND OF\nDREAM WAS DOOMED AND GIVEN HOW GOOD THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN\nCHINA AND RUSSIA IS, I DON&amp;#39;T BELIEVE THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP\nWOULD CHANGE A LOT. OF COURSE I BELIEVE THIS\nRELATIONSHIP WILL CONTINUE. DAVID:\nCAN I GET YOUR THOUGHTS AS WELL, THE STAKES DIRECTLY INTO\nCHINESE-AMERICAN RELATIONS? WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT\nWHERE THE RATIONALE IS AMIDST ALL THE NOISE.\nFROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN BEIJING, AS PRESIDENT TRUMP\nACTED IN A WAY WE WERE EXPECTING HIM TO ACT? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THIS IS AN INTERESTING\nQUESTION. I BELIEVE ONE MONTH INTO\nOFFICE, HE APPEARED QUITE FRIENDLY TOWARD CHINA IF WE\nCOME HERE -- COMPARE HIS ACTIONS TOWARD THE REST OF THE\nWORLD. SO THE QUESTION IS, WHY IS THAT?\nI BELIEVE HE HAS LEARNED SOME LESSONS FROM THE FIRST TERM AND SHOULD KNOW THAT\nHIS SIGNATURE UNPREDICTABILITY WOULD NOT WORK ON THAT.\nHE WOULD KNOW THAT HIS TARIFFS DURING THE FIRST TERM ON\nCHINESE PRODUCTS WILL BE ACTUALLY PAID BY AMERICAN\nCONSUMERS. AND HE SHOULD KNOW THIS TIME\nTHAT CHINA STILL DEPENDS ON THE UNITED STATES. DAVID: OK, I THINK WE ARE HAVING SOME\nTECHNICAL ISSUES WITH OUR GUEST JOINING US OUT OF MAINLAND\nCHINA. HE SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTER\nFOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITIES. WE WILL TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN\nGET HIM BACK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BREAK.\nTALKING GEOPOLITICS, THIS WEEK WE WILL HAVE SPECIAL COVERAGE\nAND THE ARMS RACE WHEN IT COMES TO DRONES.\nCOMPETITION THAT INVOLVES THE U.S., ALLIES AND MAINLAND CHINA.\nOUR TECH REPORTER ANNABELLE DROULERS EXPLAINS HOW DRONES\nARE SET TO PLAY AND THEY BEEN BIGGER ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO\nWARFARE. HAVE A LOOK. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE&amp;#39;S NO QUESTION DRONES\nHAVE ALTERED THE DYNAMICS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS.\nUNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES HAVE BEEN IN USE FOR DECADES\nINCLUDING IN THE COLD WAR, VIETNAM AND BY THE U.S.\nTO STRIKE REMOTE TARGETS AFTER 9/11.\nON TODAY&amp;#39;S BATTLEFIELDS, IT IS DIFFERENT.\nAT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF UAVS IN THE SKIES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE CURRENT WAR IN UKRAINE\nIS VERY MUCH A DRONE WERE ALREADY. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE SITUATION IS BEING\nMIRRORED IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH HAMAS AND ISRAELI FORCES\nDEPLOYING UAVS EXTENSIVELY. IT&amp;#39;S A SIGNAL OF WHAT IS AHEAD\nWITH THE U.S. SPENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS\nTO SECURE A NEW DRONES THROUGH THE SO-CALLED REPLICATOR\nPROGRAM. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IF THERE&amp;#39;S A MAJOR POWER\nWAR, IT WILL BE A DRONE MORE. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING FAST\nPARTICULARLY AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAS INTEGRATED\nINTO UAVS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; AIR SUPERIORITY IN FUTURE\nCONFLICT WILL NOT JUST BE ABOUT FIGHTER JETS.\nIT WILL BE ABOUT DRONE SWARMS, MUNITIONS AND AI POWERED\nTARGETING SYSTEMS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THERE&amp;#39;S ALSO A QUESTION\nTARGETING AS MILITARY NEEDS TO PROCURE A LONG -- LARGE FORCE\nOF DRONES. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THE U.S.\nAND EUROPEAN STATES ACTUALLY FOR A LONG TIME HAVE INVESTED A\nLOT MORE IN THE MORE SOPHISTICATED LONG-RANGE DRONES\nTHAT HAVE LOTS OF SENSORS TO THEM.\nIT IS REALLY THE MID AND LOWER STUFF THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO\nBUILD UP BECAUSE AS WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE RUSSIANS, THE\nNUMBERS DO MATTER. REPORTER: CHINA IS THE LEADER IN\nCOMMERCIAL FIRM -- DRONE PRODUCTION SUPPLYING AROUND 80%\nOF THE GLOBAL CONSUMER UAB MARKET AND BEIJING HAS SEEN\nTHESE AS A DUAL USE TECHNOLOGY. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; THEY HAVE BEEN REAL PIONEERS\nIN CHEAP COMMERCIAL DRONES WHICH CAN BE ADAPTED FOR\nMILITARY USE. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; IT&amp;#39;S CLEAR THIS IS AN AREA\nWHERE CHINA IS PUTTING INTENSE CAPITAL, BUT ALSO POLICY FOCUS.\nI THINK THE CHINESE RECOGNIZED QUITE EARLY THAT DRONES COULD\nBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VICTORY AND DEFEAT. REPORTER: NOW BEIJING&amp;#39;S RIVALS ARE RACING\nTO CATCH UP. ANNABELLE DROULERS, BLOOMBERG\nNEWS. DAVID: WE WILL HAVE PLENTY MORE AHEAD\nHERE ON THE CHINA KEEP IT HERE. ♪ DAVID:\nWELCOME BACK, YOU ARE WATCHING THE CHINA SHOW.\nWE ARE BACK WITH RETIRED SENIOR COLONEL OF THE PEOPLE&amp;#39;S\nLIBERATION ARMY ZHOU BO, HE&amp;#39;S THE CURRENT SENIOR FELLOW FOR INTERNATIONAL\nSECURITY AND STRATEGY. APOLOGIES FOR SOME OF THE\nTECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES BUT I THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT\nRELATIONS IF YOU COULD CONTINUE YOUR THOUGHTS. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; YOU WERE ASKING WHETHER\nTHERE MIGHT BE A NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD CHINA WITH TRUMP.\nTHIS IS SHEER SPECULATION, I HOPE IT WAS NOT HALLUCINATION.\nAFTER SEEING HOW HE HAS ACTED IN A DIFFERENT WAY AGAINST\nCHINA, I THINK THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT ACTUALLY DURING HIS SECOND TERM, THE\nCHINESE-AMERICAN RELATIONSHIP MIGHT IMPROVE CONTRARY TO MOST\nSPECULATION. HIS LEGACY IN HIS FIRST TERM\nACTUALLY IS KIND OF A BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS AGAINST\nCHINA. I DON&amp;#39;T THINK HE WANTS THAT HIMSELF BUT HE HAS LONG ELECTED\nSOME CHINA HAWKS LIKE PETER NAVARRO OR SECRETARY OF STATE\nPOMPEO TO HIJACK THIS RELATIONSHIP. WHO WOULD BE IN THE BEST\nRELATIONSHIP TO CHANGE IT? HIMSELF.\nSO THIS GIVES ME SOME HOPE. WE WILL SEE. REBECCA: WE ALSO NONETHELESS HAVE SEEN\nTHIS FLURRY OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS OVER\nTHE WEEKEND, NOT LEAST THE SHIFT ON CEPHAS, THE CHANGE ON\nU.S. INVESTMENT, THE PRESSURE ON MEXICO TO INTRODUCE ITS OWN\nTARIFFS ON CHINA. DO YOU THINK THESE COMPONENTS\nAND DIFFERENT PIECES OF NEWS WE&amp;#39;VE HAD, IS THIS A CHANGE IN\nTHE RESPONSE OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS BEIJING? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE, BUT\nWHAT IS INTERESTING FOR ME IS THAT HIS TARIFF ON CHINA IS\nLOWERED THAN ON CANADA AND MEXICO WITH HIS 25%. CHINA WOULD SWIFTLY RETALIATE\nWITH 15% ON SELECT AMERICAN ITEMS. SO BECAUSE HE&amp;#39;S TALKING\nABOUT 60%, JUST IMAGINE, AT THE ELECTION, THIS TURNED OUT TO BE\nMUCH MORE MILD THAN EXPECTED. THAT GIVES ME A LOT OF\nSPECULATION. I DON&amp;#39;T KNOW WHERE THE FUTURE\nWILL GO BUT THE REAL HOPE IS THAT IT COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM\nHIS FIRST TERM AND COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM HIS PREDECESSOR.\nACTUALLY JOE BIDEN WAS QUITE FRIENDLY TOWARD CHINA.\nHE WAS EVEN CALLED BEIJING&amp;#39;S JOE. BUT APPARENTLY HE COULD NOT\nWALK OUT OF THE TRAP LAID OUT BY THE CHINA HAWKS SO HE\nDOUBLED DOWN ON THE ROAD OF COMPETITION WITH CHINA TO HAVE\nTHIS SO-CALLED -- SO I HAVE SOME HOPE. DAVID:\nDO YOU THINK THERE&amp;#39;S A CHANCE WE GET A MEETING BETWEEN XI\nJINPING AND DARE I SAY BEIJING&amp;#39;S DONALD JUST TO USE\nTHAT ANALOGY? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN\nBECAUSE THE DIRECT TOP WITH TOP LEADERS WOULD BE MOST USEFUL\nAND SIGNIFICANT. I&amp;#39;M AWARE OF THE REMARKS BY THE\nRUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN CHINA. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW PRESIDENT\nXI JINPING HAS ACCEPTED RUSSIA&amp;#39;S INVITATION TO GO TO\nMOSCOW AND ATTEND THE COMMEMORATIONS OF THE SOVIET\nVICTORIES OVER NAZIS. THE CHINESE MEDIA DID NOT\nCONFIRM THAT BUT NORMALLY ON SUCH THINGS, CHINESE MEDIA\nWOULD ONLY MAKE ANNOUNCEMENTS A FEW DAYS BEFORE SUCH THINGS.\nBUT HIS -- IT IS INTERESTING THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR HAS\nMENTIONED IT. THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION IS,\nI BELIEVE RUSSIA HAS ALSO INVITED PRESIDENT TRUMP.\nSO WOULD TRUMP GO THERE? IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT WOULD BE\nREALLY REALLY INTERESTING. REBECCA: THERE IS A QUESTION IN\nWASHINGTON THAT SOME HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A\nPOTENTIAL DEAL BETWEEN TRUMP AND PUTIN EFFECTIVELY GIVES\nPRESIDENT XI A GREEN LIGHT TO INVADE TAIWAN.\nHAS ANYTHING REALLY CHANGED ON TAIWAN?\nWOULD ANY KIND OF DEAL BETWEEN TRUMP AND PUTIN CHANGE HOW\nTRUMP -- BEIJING THINKS ABOUT TAIWAN? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; I DON&amp;#39;T THINK SO. PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT\nUKRAINE TODAY WILL BE TAIWAN TOMORROW, BUT THIS IS A REALLY\nREALLY BIG ISSUE. SO IF YOU OBSERVE, YOU WILL FIND THAT THE CHINESE\nGOVERNMENT IS STILL TALKING ABOUT PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION. THE FACT IS THAT TWO LEADERS OF\nTAIWAN, BUT STILL TALKING ABOUT PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION.\nWHY SHOULD WE LOSE CONFIDENCE? BECAUSE TAIWAN WOULD NOT MOVE\nAWAY, SO THERE IS NO SUCH A HURRY.\nI KNOW WE HAVE NEVER ANNOUNCED A TIMETABLE.\nTHAT&amp;#39;S MOST IMPORTANT. I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE STILL\nCONFIDENT. A BIG QUESTION FOR CHINA IS\nWITH THE STRENGTHS OF CHINA MAKE CHINA MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT\nPEACEFUL REUNIFICATION OR MAKE A CHINA MORE IMPATIENT TO\nRESORT TO USE OF FORCE. I BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER IS\nTHAT WE ARE STILL HAVING CONFIDENCE. DAVID:\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE TIME. SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CHAIN WHY\nUNIVERSITY CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND\nSTRATEGY. PLENTY MORE AHEAD ON THE CHINA\nAND BLOOMBERG TELEVISION THIS MONDAY. REBECCA:REBECCA: GOOD MORNING.\nYOU ARE WATCHING THE CHINA SHOW. RESEARCHERS AT THE WUHAN SEAT\nOF VIROLOGY SAY THEY HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW CORONAVIRUS\nTHAT ENTERS CELLS AS THE SAME VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.\nFOR MORE, LET&amp;#39;S BRING IN OUR CHINA CORRESPONDENT MINMIN LOW.\nREPORTER: THIS IS A NEW VIRUS THAT IS\nRELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS FAMILY THAT CAUSED COVID-19 AND\nALSO THE MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME THAT\nKILLED MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THE PEOPLE IT INFECTED.\nABOUT 2600 PEOPLE UP TO THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR MOSTLY IN\nSAUDI ARABIA. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT\nATTACHES ITSELF TO THE HUMAN BODY IN A LESS EFFICIENT WAY\nTHAN THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19, SO THE RISK OF THIS\nBLOWING UP INTO A FULL-BLOWN PANDEMIC AT THE SAME RATE OF\nCOVID-19 IS LESS LIKELY. STILL IT ATTACHES ITSELF TO THE\nHUMAN BODY BY BINDING TO A PROTEIN THAT&amp;#39;S PRESENT IN\nHUMANS AND OTHER MAMMALS SO THERE&amp;#39;S THE RISK IT CAN JUMP\nFROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS DIRECTLY OR THROUGH AN INTERMEDIATE\nHOST. THAT&amp;#39;S WHY WE ARE SEEING THESE TALKS OF VACCINE MAKERS\nAND DIAGNOSTIC MAKERS IN SOUTH KOREA .\nTHE STOCKS ARE QUITE MIXED IN CHINA THOUGH. THE WUHAN INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGY\nSOUNDS FAMILIAR BECAUSE IT IS THE CENTER THAT HAS BEEN MIRED\nIN CONTROVERSY OVER THE ORIGINS OF COVID-19. THE U.S.\nACCUSING IT OF LEAKING THE INFECTION THROUGH AN INFECTED\nWORKER BUT THE CLAIMS ARE STILL CONTESTED BECAUSE THE U.S.\nDOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO CONCLUDE THAT.\nTHE U.S. HAS HALTED FUNDING FOR THIS\nINSTITUTE SINCE 2023. DAVID: THANK YOU.\nMINMIN LOW ON THE LATEST ON THIS AND SUFFICE TO SAY WE WILL\nTRACK THIS ONE A LOT MORE CLOSELY THAN MANY OTHER THINGS\nBECAUSE OF CERTAIN EVENTS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS OR SO.\nA COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS, A CHANGE OF PACE.\nDECLINES RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY. SOME OF THESE AGRICULTURAL\nSTOCKS IN MAINLAND CHINA ON THE BACK OF DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES\nTO PROMOTE THE SECTOR. ALIBABA IS OUT WITH A NUMBER\nCONFIRMING THAT EARLIER REPORT AND IT WILL BE INVESTING MORE\nTHAN $50 BILLION U.S. IN AI AND THE CLOUD IN THE NEXT\nTHREE YEARS OR SO. WE LEAVE YOU WITH A LOOK AT THE\nHANG SENG INDEX. SEE YOU ALL TOMORROW.\nHAVE A GOOD REST OF YOUR MONDAY."
